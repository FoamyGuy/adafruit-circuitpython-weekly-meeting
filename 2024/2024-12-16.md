### 06:41 Project of the Week: Night Light Turned Into a Weather Cloud
  

Reddit user shoddyperspectiveV2 demonstrates a nice CircuitPython project - Reddit.
"Purchased some cute night lights. I installed an Adafruit Feather V2 (with CircuitPython 9.2.1) and an Adafruit Jewel. Added a battery and power switch. It pulls the weather code from open metro which is assigned a colour and pushed to the NeoPixels. Changed switch position from version one. On the bottom works better than on the side. Easy cute project."

## 17:15 Hug reports
@foamyguy (hosting)
* @Cooper for smart light API naming ideas and color temperature knowledge link
* @DJDevon3 for stopping by the stream, it’s nice to see you
* @Shubham0x13 for optimizations in display text library
* @jepler for looking into a driver library that had longint overflow on some devices and spotting an issue with the code that was making use of the longint + another for meeting reminder ping today
* Group hug

18:41 @danh
* @EJG Morrington and @jfabernathy, both in discord, for discovering CircuitPython problems
* @foamyguy for continuing to resolve many long-open library issues and pull requests
* @jepler for quickly getting Raspberry Pi RP1 PIO working




19:37 @jepler
* Group hug & happy holidays
* @clever (on discord) for some discussion of RP1 PIO limitations


20:12 @tannewt
* NYC Adafruiters for hosting Ari and I. Nice to see everyone.

## 20:34 Status Updates

20:58 @foamyguy (hosting)
* Various Library issues        
   * HX711 longint issue
   * BMP280 changed the examples to use same pin as learn guide for CS
   * LED_Animation - Fix an issue with comet tail length > 256. And make period into a settable property for rainbow
* Wrote first draft of library that allows integration with wiz connected lights. They have several ways to be controlled, this library uses UDP on the local network to send them commands. 
* Continued work on Karel the Robot implementation. Now has loading world state, and validating world state against a goal. Scaled the sprites up to 24px. Added ability for multiple beepers at same location
* Copied from Ladyada’s recent video, got a set of ikea Alex drawers and start organizing parts and pieces better


24:01 @danh
* CircuitMatter:
   * Coded AES-CCM using our CircuitPython aesio. Not tested yet.
   * Had to recode TLV code to work on CIrcuitPython– it’s buggy right now, and I’m debugging (I can debug on CPython, which is easier).
* New deep-sleep USB problem to research.
* Fixed broken USB on tip-of-main builds.


25:30 @jepler
* Put pi5 pio neopixel on github.
* PRd support for it in the main blinka package, not yet merged (update: Limor just merged it, so that’ll be in the next release of Blinka! You might still need to manually install Adafruit-Blinka-Raspberry-Pi5-Neopixel manually, and do the necessary kernel & firmware updates)
* Working on pi5 pio rgbmatrix driver.
   * There are still some ghosting issues but the basics are working properly
   * Next steps are to add chained & serpentine panel support
   * Slightly limited by the inability to transfer more than 64kB to the PIO peripheral at once, issue filed: https://github.com/raspberrypi/utils/issues/107


27:11 @Paul Cutler
* The discussion around #CircuitPython2025 got me thinking about my podcast and I’ve decided to bring back The CircuitPython Show.  I sent out a bunch of episode invitations this morning, so check your inbox, you might just have one! (And if you’re interested in appearing on the show, let me know)


27:37 @tannewt
* In Michigan visiting family. Working some this week but off and on.
* Goal is to get caught up on emails and reviews and connect up the Zephyr port to the Zephyr UART.
* Working on #CircuitPython2025 kick off post. Gotta get email setup and ideally graphics before too.
