### 04:56 SPECIAL: Raspberry Pi Releases the New RP2350 Microcontroller and Pico 2 Board
Raspberry Pi has released a new microcontroller, the RP2350, last Thursday in conjunction with DEF CON 23 (the official badge uses the new chip). A new board was also released, the Raspberry Pi Pico 2. The RP2350 comes in four packages, two with 30 pins and two with 48 pins providing additional GPIO (the secondary versions add 2MB of flash). The new chips use two Arm Cortex M33 cores + floating point unit and also have two RISC-V HAZARD3 cores (only two cores usable at a time). The clock speed is bumped to 150 MHz. With the new architecture and floating point along with 3 PIO units, the speed is about double at stock clocks, while using less power. Besides Raspberry Pi Pico 2, there are over 30 boards announced at launch from a variety of vendors - Raspberry Pi News, RP2350 Datasheet (PDF), Pico 2 Datasheet (PDF)
Adafruit's Ladyada discusses the RP2350 and shows the new Adafruit Feather RP2350 and Metro RP2350 - YouTube.


### 06:25 MicroPython and CircuitPython Support for the RP2350 Chip
CircuitPython on Friday released version 9.2.0-alpha.2350 which includes preliminary support for the new Raspberry Pi RP2350 and minor fixes and enhancements. MicroPython has a GitHub Pull Request (PR) to its codebase to support the RP2350.
### 06:56 Newsletter Details
The Python on Microcontrollers Weekly Newsletter is a CircuitPython-community-run newsletter emailed every Monday. The complete archives are [here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/). It highlights the latest Python on hardware related news from around the web including CircuitPython, Python and MicroPython developments.

## 15:30 Hug reports


15:53 @foamyguy (hosting)
* @tannewt for review on a PR to adafruit_logging and suggestions of better way to implement the added functionality.
* Group hug to everyone participating in or planning to hang out during circuitpython day. And thanks to Anne and Liz for coordinating
* @JefferyThompson of https://www.jeffreythompson.org/collision-detection/table_of_contents.php whose collision detection web pages have been very helpful in making some circuitpython versions to be used in a breakout clone and other games
* @DavidGlaude for finding and sharing some details about cookiecutter and values used on past runs.
* @deshipu for a good tip about more efficient way to test for collision


17:02 @jerryn
* @tannewt for reviewing and merging the new Adafruit_CircuitPython_RFM library.


17:18 @johnnohj [pronounced like ‘john-know’ ] (no mic) Hug Reports for DanH and MakerMelissa for their help and patience guiding pull requests into successful merges. Further hug reports to FoamyGuy and Tannewt for continuing to offer us a glimpse into the development process with their Deep Dives/coding livestreams, and to Todbot and JohnPark, amongst others, for their humor and being positive figures who maintain a fun and welcoming community. Cheers


17:52 @makermelissa
* @danh for testing the Beta Site and finding some issues
* @elpekenin for a great suggestion about adding a check to Blinka to ensure function signatures match CircuitPython
* Group Hug


18:18 @tannewt
* @danh for posting release notes in the normal places.
* @bill88t for reporting an issue with S3 and the latest alpha.
## 18:39 Status Updates
19:04 @foamyguy (hosting)
* Submitted a few more Ruff library conversions
* Re-worked some proposed changes to adafruit_logging that added the ability to include timestamps in the log messages. The original implementation was not matching the CPython API. The revised version implements the Formatter class and adds support for the same API and behaviors found in CPython
* Working on geometry helpers for intersection and distance. Originally aiming to be used with vectorio, but am now thinking it may be better to make it more generalized and just accept numerical value inputs so it can be used in a variety of different situations even in cases where the shapes are theoretical, and aren’t being drawn on a display.
* Coded up a very basic very of the core functionality for a breakout clone. Will refine it further during Game Jam stream on CircuitPython day.


20:12 @jerryn
* Trying (and failing) to add some SPI functions to the adafruit_register library….will keep plugging away.  Just learned that Adafruit_Register_SPI already exists .. looking into it instead. My issues appear to be more in how to use it in the RFM library rather, than in how to add the functions.
* Should the Adafruit_CircuitPython_RFM library be released to get it “out there”.  Suggest a 1.0.0 (or 0.1.0?) tag.  If so, should I do that or does someone internally usually handle such things.


22:47 @makermelissa
* Worked on prepping to record a video for CircuitPython Day
* Fixed an issue where the Code Editor Beta Site wasn’t updating
* Fixed some issues with USB workflow that Dan found with the Code Editor
* Will be filming my video today and editing after that


23:20 @tannewt
* Last week I was heads down in RP2350 support. Alpha with early support is out. Will follow up soon with another alpha. Maybe alpha.2351 or alpha.3000?
* Need to test RGBMatrix support.
* USB host via PIO needs to be fixed.
* Low power support needs to be added as well.
* Bug fixing so we can get 9.2.0 stable!
* One hour Deep Dive on Friday for CircuitPython Day!
