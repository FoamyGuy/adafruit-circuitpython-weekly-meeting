### Adafruit Grand Opening in Industry Center, Brooklyn, New York
On September 20th, Adafruit had a grand opening in their new Brooklyn, New York factory at [Industry City](https://blog.adafruit.com/2024/08/08/adafruit-industry-city/). A special thanks to the President of the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce, the Managing Director of Industry City, and the Vice President of Partnerships at the NYC EDC - [X](https://x.com/adafruit/status/1837876968366239774).
*A quick reminder that Adafruit doesn't have a store or tours, they're just making cool products in their factory that you order online.*
### 3:50 MicroPython Memory Profiler
[Planet Innovation](https://planetinnovation.com/) has released the MicroPython Memory Profiler under an open MIT license. It’s an in-house tool originally written mostly by Damien George (MicroPython's creator) for a project where fragmented memory was an issue when running a device for many hours/days - [GitHub](https://github.com/pi-mst/micropython-memory-profiler).

## 12:40 Hug reports


12:56 @tannewt
* @Brandon-Hurst at ADI for making a PR to CircuitPython for MAX32690 support.


13:26 @danh
* @tannewt for doing most of the work of updating to the new ESP-IDF I2C driver.
* @jepler for careful review of my i2C driver update PR
* @samblenny for core contributions
* @RetiredWizard for code cleanups


14:14 @foamyguy
* @johnnohj for sharing some good resources on finding points along a line
* @danh for cleaning up some leftover server files in the esp32spi library


14:44 @jepler
* @danh for working on the expressif i2c update and everything that touches
* Group hug


15:09 @samBlenny (text only)
* @tannewt and @danh for help with PRs for USB stuff


## 15:28 Status Updates
15:40 @tannewt
* Continuing work on CircuitMatter. Currently establishing a *certificate* based secure channel. This is the (hopefully) later part of commissioning a new device. This is the same process as re-joining after a reset.
* Attestation and node operational credentials are being received.
* Added IO4 and IO7 to Feather RP2350 board to match silk screen.


17:08 @danh
* I made a PR for Espressif to update to the new I2C driver. Scott had written most of the code already. The esp32-camera library had just been updated to support the new library. But the camera did not work after putting both updates together. After a lot of debugging, found out the problem was a bug in the updated camera driver, not any bug in the new I2C driver. A 16-bit value was being byteswapped twice instead of once.
*  The new I2C driver also appears to fix several open Espressif I2C issues, including with seesaw.
* There are about eight more issues to address for CircuitPython 9.2.0.


19:50 @foamyguy
* Working on Adabot actions to skip pushing updates to bundles if the bundles aren’t able to be built successfully. Can’t easily test it in the “real” environment, but in the testing I can do it seems to be successfully blocking now in the PR that I submitted. 
* Adabot PR is failing actions from some of the tests failing. I believe it’s unrelated to the bundle build test job but I am digging further to try understand the root cause and get the tests back to passing.
* Started displayio based Spirit Board project, well known by the trademarked name “Ouija” board. 
   * Instead of spirits, the messages are received from adafruit.io. You can set your message ahead of time and then play with friends and family
   * Current version is on PyPortal Titano, but I intend to make versions for the standard Pyportal, and perhaps for the TFT Featherwings that have the same sizes as those respective pyportals
   * Implemented some displayio helpers for it to make use of: AnchoredTilegrid which has anchor_point and anchored_position like the ones from display_text. And a slide() function that moves a tilegrid from one location to another along a line.


22:12 @jepler
* Finished my long rp2350 checklist. Things are in good shape for this new mcu
* Working on ps2io
* On deck is working on an “audio fx” like code.py for circuitpython
* Did a countdown project for myself to exercise e-ink & deep sleep (esp32-s3 feather)


24:57 @Mark[gamblor] (may be missing)
* Did a lot of clean-up on audio effect processing so I have a template for other effects
* Starting adding more commenting to guide others if they want to add an effect
* Plan to review everything again. Close to coming out of draft.


25:48 @samBlenny (text only)
* Working on improving exception handling for quirky USB devices
## 26:02 In The Weeds



## 26:10 Wrap-Up
* Next meeting as usual on 10/7.
