## 2:10 Community News
### 2:35 CircuitPython 9.2.0 Released
CircuitPython 9.2.0, the latest minor revision of CircuitPython (although packed with enough for a major step), is a new stable release. - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2024/10/28/circuitpython-9-2-0-released/) and [GitHub Release Notes](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases/tag/9.2.0).
**Notable changes in 9.2.0 from 9.1.x**
- Raspberry Pi RP2350 support.
- Update to Espressif ESP-IDF V5.3.1, including new I2C driver.
- Merge MicroPython updates from v1.22.2 and v1.23.
- Espressif BLE improvements.
- Add `math.dist()`.
- `_eve` updates.
-  New `busio.I2C.probe()` and `bitbangio.I2C.probe()` methods to check for a single device address
- ESP32-S3: implement `sdioio`.
- New `audiodelay`s and `audiofilters` modules. These modules are experimental, and the API may change.
### 4:15 MicroPython v1.24.0 Released
The new MicroPython v1.24.0 adds support for the new Raspberry Pi RP2350 MCU, improves RISC-V support with native code generation, supports ESP32-C6 MCUs, updates the Zephyr version with threading support, adds unified TinyUSB bindings across ports, adds a portable UART IRQ API, and has enhanced mpremote recursive copy. There are also numerous bug fixes, enhancements to the test suite and more attention to testing of the machine module and its API. For more details see [GitHub Release Notes](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/releases/tag/v1.24.0).
### 5:12 Arduino Brings Its MicroPython Editor to the Cloud with a Browser-Based Web App Release
The web appears to be a popular place to edit MicroPython and CircuitPython apps with the latest entry being from the Arduino team. At the moment the editor is still in the 'lab' phase with bug fixes and improvements planned. A webserial browser is required (Firefox would need [an extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/webserial-for-firefox/)) - [hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/news/arduino-brings-its-micropython-editor-to-the-cloud-with-a-browser-based-web-app-release-310179492abc) and [Arduino](https://lab-micropython.arduino.cc/) (Arduino log-in required).
### 6:11 A Roundup of CircuitPython Website Upgrades

## 18:30 Hug reports


@danh (hosting)
* @mikeysklar for fixing WebSerialESPTool so it works again on boards that use a passthrough program like PyPortal and MatrixPortal
* @FoamyGuy for continued improvements to circuitpython.org
* @jepler for general fix for non-JSON’able types and other recent fixes
* @bablokb for fixing RP2350 cpu.temperature
* @eightycc for bringing cyw43-driver up to date
* @bill88t for finding an RP2350 cache bug


21:00 @foamyguy
* Anne for showing the ropes of the blog authoring system
* Liz for working with me on the VCNL4200 driver and wrangling some of the trickier bits


21:25 @jepler
* Dcooperdalrymple for some useful contributions & thoughtful interactions
* Kevinjwalters for reporting some synthio issues & papercuts
## 21:45 Status Updates
@danh (hosting)
* Fixed RP2350 cache bug. Getting ready for a 9.2.1 release, which is not urgent.
* Studying Matter and looking at CircuitMatter. Got it to work on Apple Home.


23:20 @foamyguy
* Try out new style for built-in modules list on circuitpython.org pages. Settled on using the existing  styling and applying it to the new list of features. Researched the liquid template docs to figure out a way to fix the extra commas and spacing within those lists of links.
* Wrote content and recorded video for use in custom LED Animation guide. Submitted for moderation now, out soon.
* Library PR Reviews: Scrolling Label improvement, TemplateEngine refactor and improvements, and a more advanced Fingerprint example for rpi.
* Learned how to build the unix port and write tests that run against it.


25:11 @jepler
* Primarily working on supporting the “FM” flux encoding in Adafruit_Floppy for 8” floppy emulation. This will be in the Arduino environment, not CircuitPython.
* In CircuitPython, some small pull requests
* Working to get the block biquad PR to mergeable state (the test was first not pushed, and then it was broken)
* Reviewed some other PRs
* Learned that there’s a firefox extension that can support webserial https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/webserial-for-firefox/ in case that is helpful to anyone else. It worked with the webserial terminal from the newsletter. A helper program is required to be installed on your system, but it seemed to start automatically when a page accessed webserial (at least that was my impression)
* Working on reducing my overall number of open issues (that I filed) on github. You can get a list of all issues you ever filed across all repos, and I’m closing old ones that I don’t care about anymore, if they haven’t seen any activity or interest from others. Currently at 149 open issues, not sure what my goal is


## 26:55 In The Weeds


@danh
* The download counts for libraries and Blinka above are very large. After looking at this, I think this is because there are thousands of downloads happening when CircuitPython is built for highest-download libraries. Given those inaccuracies, I am thinking we might just discontinue these download statistics, and save some time during the meeting.
## 31:33 Wrap-Up
Next meeting is **Tuesday, November 12**, at the regular time of day, due to a US holiday on Monday.
