## \#\# 02:03 Community News

\#\#\# 02:07 Python 3.13 (Final) Released

Python 3.13.0 is the newest major release of the Python programming language, and it contains many new features and optimizations compared to Python 3.12. (Compared to the last release candidate, 3.13.0rc3, 3.13.0 contains two small bug fixes and some documentation and testing changes) \- [Python Insider Blog](https://pythoninsider.blogspot.com/2024/10/python-3130-final-released.html).

\#\#\# 02:31 CircuitPython 9.2.0 Beta 1 Released

CircuitPython 9.2.0-beta.1 is a beta release for 9.2.0. There are a few known bugs that will be fixed before the final release of 9.2.0 \- [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2024/10/10/circuitpython-9-2-0-beta-1-released/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases/tag/9.2.0-beta.1).

Highlights:

* Many bug fixes since 9.2.0-beta.0.  
* New busio.I2C.probe() and bitbangio.I2C.probe() methods to check for a single device address.  
* Use new ESP-IDF I2C driver.  
* ESP32-S3: Add sdioio.  
* Incompatible change: Change default hostname for all Espressif boards to the ESP-IDF default, which is espressif. Previous board-specific names were not applied consistently. Use wifi.radio.hostname to set a custom hostname.  
* Incompatible change: Use default hostname for mDNS. Fix mDNS collision mangling.

## \#\# 11:28 Hug reports

11:45 @Liz (hosting)

* Group hug\!

12:05 @danh

* @aseanwatson for finding an issue with keypad.ShiftRegisterKeys.

12:17 @foamyguy

* @johnnohj for working on DisplayIO examples for libraries  
* @SamBlenny for sharing a neat Halloween themed game based on DisplayIO.  
* Group hug

12:38 @jepler

* Group hug  
* Hug for Mark for working on the audio effects stuff\! (sorry for the confusion with my “Audio FX” project\!)

12:57 @Mark\[gamblor21\] (missing)

* @dcooperdalrymple for all his work on the audio effects PR with me  
* @tannewt for all his audio effects reviews  
* @jepler for quickly answering a question I had about a build issue  
* Group hug\!

13:14 @tannewt

* Dan, Jeff, Tim and everyone else for covering for me as I have paternity leave. It’s immensely helpful to know things will continue without me for the time being.

## \#\# 13:39 Status Updates

14:02 @Liz (hosting)

* I’ve worked on two arduino projects the past week. The first was using an RP2040 USB Host Feather to create a turbo button gamepad. The Feather acts as a transparent passthrough for the controller and sends any button pushes. When a specific combo is pressed, it sends a turbo button aka a rapidly pressed A button. The second project uses the QT Py CH32V203. I put together a simple eInk daily calendar with it using an EYESPI BFF and a STEMMA RTC module.

14:36 @danh

* Released CircuitPython 9.2.0-beta.1, which catches up on several weeks worth of changes.  
* New sphinx version broke building the docs; I pinned it temporarily. This happens often. Some of the issues I encountered with sphinx have been fixed already.  
* Brought GitHub Actions CI operating system version choices up to date.  
* Continuing to fix bugs for 9.2.0 final. Fixed keypad and RP2350 bugs. Working on Espressif BLE at the moment.  
* Tried Scott’s CircuitMatter build; some prerequisite issues, but got it working.

17:15 @foamyguy

* Ran a patch to fix sphinx theme configuration for all of the libraries and used the Adabot release tool to make a new release for all of them afterward.  
* Created a new library to hold the AnchoredTileGrid class that is used by my spirit board project, but has other more general usages as well  
* Made the changes necessary to the spirit board project to run on the smaller screen size that is used on the standard PyPortal.  
* Tested a few ways to use symlinks in Learn guide projects and their effect on the project bundler  
* Found an issue with the RTD container os version configuration that is in cookie cutter and 1 other new library, submitted PR to both with the fix.

19:25 @jepler

* Finished my guide about CircuitPython Polyphonic Audio FX, it’s live on learn.adafruit.com  
* Spent most of last week on my personal project, a VT100-style terminal on RP2040 (in C, not CircuitPython)  
* Short list of items to work on next:  
  * Monophonic Audio FX version  
  * Arduino / Floppsy stuff:  
    * MFM floppy emulator  
    * MFM floppy image to SD card

20:32 @Mark\[gamblor21\] (missing)

* Audioeffects is good to do a final review on  
* I plan to add more effects and work on it more after the initial release

20:45 @tannewt

* Less than two weeks until baby is due\! Will be out afterwards for four weeks.  
* Working on CircuitMatter interfacing with Apple Home.  
  * Added chunking to responses because Apple Home reads all attributes up front.  
  * Seemingly crashing homepod mini.  
  * matter.js shows an error with my response so I’m hoping fixing that will fix apple home.
