## 17:07 Hug reports
@foamyguy (hosting)
* @Tyeth for researching some python inheritance specifics about how to call a “grandparent” super init function instead of the “parent” like usual.
* @MakerMelissa welcome back, and thank you for adding many 3rd party board how-to links to circuitpython.org
* @GordieGii for pointing out the cause of a visual issue I was seeing during stream


18:34 @danh
* @foamyguy for working on the backlog of CircuitPython library PR’s and issues.
* @melissa - great to have you back


19:10 @jepler
* Group hug
* Hug to Melissa, happy to see you are picking up some CircuitPython & Blinka work again.
* @foamyguy for fixing a bitmap label bug I ran into awhile back (as well as a ton of other issues!!!)
* This week marks 5 years since I made Adafruit my primary work and I’m really grateful for all the time I’ve had in this wonderful community, learning how to do all sorts of things.


19:47 @Liz (likely notes only)
* Melissa - welcome back 🎉
* Jeff for reviewing a Learn repo PR that involved looking at a recent refactor in FastLED that was causing CI to break
## 20:09 Status Updates
20:44 @foamyguy (hosting)
* Refactored and cleaned up TextBox widget & submitted PR
* Add a FilledPolygon class to Display_Shapes library and made both it and the existing Polygon class support stroke argument for the size of the outline like all the other shapes do.
* Internal refactor inside i2c._send() function in BlinkaDisplayio that was suggested in an issue. It resolves an issue resulting in sleep() and wake() not working for SSD1306 and SH1106 displays
* Rotation fix in SH1107 for 90 degree offset when setting rotation after init
* Display_Text fix to error about incorrect arguments & fix for BitmapLabel ascenders and descenders
* Added LinearLayout to Displayio_Layout library


24:19 @danh
* I fixed a problem with I2CTarget not working after a soft restart.
* CircuitMatter: I couldn’t find a straightforward replacement for ecdsa library among other available elliptic curve libraries. Now I’m reading the spec and the code to figure out what capabilities are needed.


26:00 @jepler
* I’ve been working in the Arduino environment on floppy emulation.
   * Current task is to get “FM” data modulation working
   * Xerox 820 CPM computer doesn’t like the data I’m producing .. yet.
   * It looks like I might be producing an incorrect sector header but I don’t know why yet
* Small things in the circuitpython world such as code reviews
