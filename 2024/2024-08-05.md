## 21:30 Status Updates


22:00 @danh (hosting)
* On vacation last week.
* Working on MicroPython v1.22 merge. Need to fix several test failures. Light testing of builds is looking good.


22:43 @anne
* I’m working with Liz on scheduling folks for CircuitPython Day
* Please use hashtag #CircuitPythonDay2024 for any social media on participation, even projects or discussions.
* This coming Python on Microcontrollers Newsletter is #300!!


24:50 @DJDevon3 (text only)
* Due to recent updates for soft_keyboard and imageload I’ve been updating some of my touchscreen GUI’s with the new features. The ability to use a wider variety of image formats while interacting with online API’s is much easier now. 
* Working on new adafruit_requests API examples for basic image downloads with multiple image formats. 
* Have family visiting this week that I haven’t seen in a decade along with one tiny new family member. I’m now a great Uncle, time flies.


25:30 @deshipu (text only)
* did some old todos around displayio and images
* I will try working on some sound effects next


25:45 @foamyguy
* Started merging the previously created PRs from a handful of libraries that switched to ruff after updating them to have the version of configuration that we settled on. 
* Build a quick / minimal PoC of a web app that converts cookiecutter from a CLI into a web page based form. Live Demo Page and Source Code
* Tested and reviewed a few PRs for the ImageLoad library that added easier support for PNG with transparency, and support for RGB and Grayscale PNGs.
* Tested a fix in Blinka_DisplayIO for making it compatible with sleep functionality found on some OLED displays
* Brainstorming ideas for a game to work on for Circuitpython Day Game Jam stream. Built a quick PoC of a breakout style game and dreamed up several ideas to add to it. Still considering a few other options as well.


27:02 @jerryn
* Finally submitted a PR with the initial commit for a library that combines the RFM69 and RFM9x support. https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_RFM/pull/1 The biggest changes are the usage of asyncio and the addition of FSK/OOK modulation to the RFM9x. RFM69 and RFM9x boards can communicate with each using FSK or OOK modulation. It would be good if someone could take a look at the asyncio implementation and let me know it looks reasonable.


28:55 @makermelissa
* We have a CircuitPython Code Editor beta website at code-beta.circuitpython.org that has the latest features. If anybody would like to be a beta tester and try out the site, that would be awesome. If you find any issues, just open up a GitHub issue.
* On that site, I’ve:
   * Worked on improving the reliability of the USB Workflow
   * Added features to allow performing multiple file operations at the same time such as file selection, deleting, downloading, and moving.
   * Displaying additional information about the board in all of the workflows
* Finishing up some other minor improvements today
* Working on prepping to film video for CP day.


30:15 @Paul Cutler (text only)
* New episode of The Bootloader podcast with todbot is out today.  Todbot and I will be doing a live episode for CircuitPython Day, details coming soon.


30:33 @tannewt
* Fixed the passcode based encryption for CircuitMatter. So I can now decode the first “secure channel” message.
* Next is plumbing in the next “interaction model” layer which may be the layer user code works on.
* Deep Dive on Friday!
## 31:45 In The Weeds


32:10 @foamyguy - Interest in web based Cookiecutter utility? 

Pros:
* Remove need for end users to install cookiecutter and its requirements
* Web form is quicker and easier for first time library contributors
* Available for, and will work the same from any OS by accessing from the browser. In the past cookiecutter or one of its requirements had differing behavior on Windows. It’s no longer the case, but having this centralized into a server or other web based utility should prevent any future differences


Cons:
* Requires some infrastructure. Currently it’s built as a Django app running inside a linux VPS which would need some level of on-going maintenance and updating in order to remain functional and secure.  
        
50:44 @todbot  (text only not present)
* ~~Is there a command-line tool for interacting with the filesystem via the Web Workflow? `circup` will do this for libraries, but I don’t think for arbitrary files. I’m thinking something like `mpremote`~~ Real-time followup from @danh: Yes, it is being worked on by @foamyguy and is called “wwshell”. Thx @foamyguy! 


Current version is available on the branch on this PR: https://github.com/adafruit/circup/pull/223
## 51:40 Wrap-Up
Next week’s meeting is Monday, August 12, 2024, at the regular time of 2pm US ET / 11 am US PT
