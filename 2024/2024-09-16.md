### Stretching the Possibilities of Soft Robots with Flexible Electronics
 Stretching the possibilities of soft robots with flexible electronics 

Prof. Rebecca Kramer-Bottiglio and a team of researchers have developed complex electronics that can stretch substantially beyond their original shape. Further, the system can be easily adapted to different uses. [The results](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scirobotics.adn6844) of their work are published in Science Robotics. As a demonstration, they developed stretchable versions of an Arduino — a widely used open-sourced electronics platform—and embedded them into soft robots - [RechXplore](https://techxplore.com/news/2024-09-possibilities-soft-robots-flexible-electronics.html).
### 2:59 Project of the Week: A Tactile AAC Board
 Tactile AAC board 

The Tactile AAC board is a 160-phrase, snap-dome button symphony for nonverbal communication. Foldable, spill-resistant, and CircuitPython-powered. The portable version has ah neck strap included. Speech tech meets absurdly practical design - [hackaday.io](https://hackaday.io/project/197545-tactile-aac-board) via [X](https://x.com/geeknik/status/1833615965621219668).

## 14:02 Hug reports
@jepler (hosting)
* Group hug
* Hug to Scott for reviews on my rp2350 PIO PRs


14:39 @danh
* @snakey maker cat for all kinds of help in discord
* @tannewt for fixing a bunch of bugs


15:07 @foamyguy
* @Tyeth for trying out the serial plotter in the web IDE and testing it directly on a device with a custom build to point to the beta version + sharing how it was done.
* @danh for reviewing a PR in the library screenshot tool that will unblock a few other fixes I’m working on
* @makermelissa for reviewing Web IDE PR.
* Group hug


15:46 @mark[gamblor] (missing)
* Hug to everyone who has provided me with positive feedback and ideas on the audio effects during Show and Tell and on the issue (especially @todbot, @tannewt, @dcooperdalrymple).


16:06 @RetiredWizard (text only)
* @deshipu for helping me understand how settings.toml parameters are read and leading me to what might be a simple solution to a board variant problem
* To all the adafruit folks for continuing to push CircuitPython in new and exciting directions, for all the streaming content and for always jumping to answer questions and solve problems via Discord, the Forums and Github channels


16:46 @tannewt
* Gamblor for working on audio effects API.
* @jepler for working on all the new PIO details
* MicroPython devs Damien, Jim and Gus for making time to sync with us


17:28 @todbot (text only)
* @Mark (Gamblor) for work on audio effects
* @danh for all the RP2350-E9 work across multiple repos
* @dcooperdalrymple for neat new synth-related libraries
* @SnakeyMakerCat for being so patient in helping on the Discord
## 17:56 Status Updates


@jepler (hosting)
* Main work on the two PRs to add rp2350 PIO features is done, but still need to work it through the review process
* Going through all built in modules on a pico2 and finding anything that doesn’t work
   * No surprises yet. I’m up to “m” in the alphabetical list, then need to go back and test some stuff that needs more HW hooked up.
   * I2c, spi, displayio, etc., all working
   * Specific Keypads that rely on pull downs might have some caveats due to the IO pad erratum
* Worked up a pure python/PIO implementation of ps2io over the last week though it doesn’t handle all the error conditions
   * Hope to convert this to be in the core soon & add all the error handling


21:44 @danh
* Finished Micropython v1.23 merge. PR is green. Only known issue is that native-code support is probably broken. Winterbloom_sol is the only board that turns it on, though people may do that privately. I will let @theacodes know. It should be fixed eventually and I made an issue for that.
* Documented RP2350 GPIO caveats in ReadTheDocs.
* Will go back to fixing bugs for 9.2.0.

23:47 @foamyguy
   * Wrote up a guide for Blinka Says cardboard game and it was published last week
   * Wrapped up the serial plotter implementation in the web IDE and it’s now live on the beta version.
   * Added a confirmation to the web workflow if you try to leave the page while it’s uploading a folder and fixed a sort-of related issue that caused the folder upload to start failing if you clicked into a directory while it was processing.
   * Working on some improvements and fixes for the screenshot utility.
   * Fix an issue causing the SD folder to be overlaid in front of / on top of one of the libraries in some cases
   * Removed a duplicated lib folder for projects that include one in their project code. It’s contents are now merged into the lib folder that contains all found dependencies
   * Updated the tool to include libraries from the community bundle
   * Updated actions and pre-commit config to use current versions of relevant utilities so that the checks will succeed and can be used in newer environments


27:16 @Mark[gamblor] (missing)
   * Plan is to get a draft audio effects PR out this week so others can start looking at it
   * Longer term plan is to write a few effects as templates and write a playground note on how others can add their own.


27:35 @tannewt
   * ESP32-P4 support is merged in without USB support.
   * Mostly fixes this week:
   * Fixed nRF reset into UF2. It only worked with ble active.
   * Fixed memory leaks with BLE workflow on ESP32.
   * Fixed incorrect detection of active VM heap by BLE workflow.
   * Fixed input buffer clearing on CTRL-C with usb/jtag/serial input. Should make CX work much better with code.cp.org.
   * Disabled touchio and enabled picodvi for RP2350 boards by default.
   * Dusted off CircuitMatter. Working to reply to a “read attribute” request at the “interaction” and “data model” layers.
