## 14:14 Hug reports
@jepler (host)
* Group hug


@CGrover (text only)
* To @Tyeth (TyethGundry) and @brentru (BrentRubell) for the AIO feed throttling features in adafruit_io. This has proven to be a real lifesaver for my multi-MPU weather sensor infrastructure. Was much easier to implement than anticipated. Thank you!


15:20 @danh
* Welcome back Scott!
* @eightycc for several PR’s and continuing work
* @timchinowsky for audio work
* @aseanwatson for noticing `keypad` regression
* @jepler for fast reviews for 9.2.1 release


16:02 @foamyguy
* @johnohj for looking up and sharing information about how github treats issues and PRs similarly within their APIs
* @Michal Pokusa for a tip about using the DISPLAY env variable in linux (rpi) to be able to launch graphical programs onto a connected display from an SSH connection.
* @Danh and @Brentru for review and discussions around a timeout fix for minimqtt.
* @Timeline for reporting an issue with filtering on Circuitpython.org


16:53 @tannewt
* Everyone for continuing our wonderful project and community while I was out. I’m happy to be back.
## 17:19 Status Updates
@jepler 
* Wrapped up work in Arduino on Floppsy
* Shifting to implement DOS/PC floppy archiving in CircuitPython
   * Sub tasks are getting floppsy board def & adafruit-circuitpython-floppy fixed up to where they work properly again on the current board revision
* Added board def & circuitpython.org listing for the pico 2 w last week


19:05 @CGrover (text only)
* This week and next week: After a long break from CircuitPython projects, I’m deep into restructuring my weather device infrastructure from the one described in this Playground Note https://adafruit-playground.com/u/CGrover/pages/display-aio-local-weather-conditions-matrixweather-system. The overarching architecture was redesigned to reduce the number of weather data source devices from two to one. The changes increased the display-only devices from one to two and will allow for many customized display-only devices to be added when/where needed. With the new architecture, each weather device will function autonomously thanks to the elegant AIO feed throttling work done by Tyeth Gundry and Brent Rubell. Of course this means that there will be a bunch of work to refactor existing devices – but the new approach has already shown a significant improvement in reliability. I’ll publish a new Playground Note that can be used as a practical example for applying AIO throttling code to a project. 
* Somewhat unrelated: I’ve been absent from the CircuitPython project world for the past few months except for a minor effort to keep existing projects working as CircuitPython continues to improve. With winter approaching, the rock band reunion tour completed, and some significant home remodeling/repair projects coming to an end (that involved a couple of trips to the emergency clinic), I’m excited to have more time available to resume work on my long list of PCB and CircuitPython projects.


20:25 @danh
* Released CircuitPython 9.2.1. Fixed a few bugs for that.
* CircuitMatter on CircuitPython:
   * Refactored to isolate ecdsa calls to a single source file which can be reworked to substitute different ecdsa code, either a slimmer Python implementation or using mbedtls.
   * Redoing DER (ASN1 encoding) code. The DER library that comes with ecdsa is Python 2/3 compatible, which makes for inefficiencies, and is not really in great shape. Also we only need a small part of it.
* CircuitPython now on Bluesky as @circuitpython.org. Also circuitpython@fosstodon.org. Release announcements will be posted to both accounts.
* Future:
   * BLE HID central: library additions and testing
   * MicroPython v1.24 merge


23:22 @eightycc
* Getting back into CircuitPython after an extended absence. It’s remarkable how quickly the Pico landscape has changed in the last months. I’m excited by the possibilities the new RP2350 opens up. The RP2040 is a fine part, but doubling the memory, adding PSRAM, and upgrading the processor cores make the RP2350 a better fit for larger projects.
* Submitted some minor PRs to practice getting my personal workflow up and running again.
* Took a deep dive into Infineon CYW43439 gSPI interfacing.
* Picked up where I left off with _bleio support for the CYW43439. Re-tooled my development and testing environment. Brought my code up to date with 9.2.x. Studied the updates that Scott and Dan made to their ESP version. Posted my WIP to my Github repo.
* Other than the packaging, I’m not seeing any differences with the Raspberry Pi RM2 vs. the bare CYW43439 part used on the Pico W.
* Will be integrating and testing the new Pico SDK 2.1.0 over the next week. This new version brings with it a plethora of RP2350-related improvements.




25:04 @foamyguy
* Library issues. MiniMQTT timeout fix from discord. Tested issues reported for BNO055 and BME280
* Circuitpython.org fix a bug with filtering downloads that I caused with recent changes. Also an issue causing it to reorder the page into the wrong order if you erase your search term.
* Started refactoring Adabot to use pygithub instead of requests for gh API.
* RPi Bluesky scroller code & guide


27:47 @tannewt
* Baby girl Rynn was born 10/29. Everyone is doing well (except for sleep deprivation.)
* Back from paternity leave until late April next year. Out some of December for holidays & travel though starting the 11th.
* Getting caught up on emails.
* Maybe starting circuitmatter port to circuitpython.




## 29:03 In The Weeds


@foamyguy
1) Break up the `Raspberrypi` processor family filter on circuitpython.org into rp2040 and rp2350 listed separately?


2) https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/pull/227 any concerns with a community library named `i2sinout`? Is this likely to clash with a core module at some point, and if so should it be renamed to something else?


34:03 @danh
* Get rid of “driver” vs “helper” distinction in bundle repo?
## 36:10 Wrap-Up
Next meeting is December 2, 2024
