### 2:32 Python 3.12.7 and 3.13 Release Candidate 3 Are Out
Two updates to the latest Python versions were released October 1st:
Python 3.12 is the newest major release of the Python programming language, and it contains many new features and optimizations. 3.12.7 is the latest maintenance release, containing more than 100 bugfixes, build improvements and documentation changes since 3.12.6 – [Python Insider Blog](https://pythoninsider.blogspot.com/2024/10/python-3127-released.html).
Python 3.13.0 release candidate 3 is the final release preview (no really) of 3.13. This release is expected to become the final 3.13.0 release, barring any critical bugs being discovered. The official release of 3.13.0 is scheduled for Monday, 2024-10-07 – [Python Insider Blog](https://blog.python.org/2024/10/python-3130-release-candidate-3-released.html).
Note: Python 3.13 delayed by “drastic change” removal of incremental garbage collector – [Dev Class](https://devclass.com/2024/10/04/python-3-13-delayed-by-drastic-change-removal-of-incremental-garbage-collector/).

## 13:00 Hug reports


@danh (hosting)
* @jepler for a quick fix for a ReadTheDocs change.
* @diamant3 for cleaning up technical debt on properties.


13:44 @foamyguy
* @snkYmkrct for resolving an issue in Display_Text and working on several displayio examples for various sensors
* @aggieNick02 for fixing an issue that caused extra empty lines to appear from the FileHandler in the adafruit_logging library
* Group hug


14:18 @jepler
* Group hug
* Hug to Dan for quick reviews on a PR this morning
* Hug to social media: Mastodon was very interested in my recent countdown clock project


14:58 @snkymkrct (Snakey Maker Cat) -- text only 
* In true adhd fashion, I usually forget to add notes to the meeting document, so this is my perpetual group hug, for the best online community!


15:13 @tannewt
* Apollon77 and qosmiof20 for help with Matter.
* Iboue for CircuitMatter improvements.
## 16:06 Status Updates
16:37 @danh (hosting)
* Fixed several bugs, including BLE and sleep issues.
* Will do another beta soon.


17:06 @foamyguy
* Continue work on an update for Adabot to test building a bundle before committing and pushing the changes that result in new bundle releases. In doing so, learned how to call click CLI commands like circuitpython-build-tool programmatically.
* Library PR testing and reviews for Logging and Display_Text fixes + a handful of new displayio examples for sensors
* Look into the sphinx build issue and submit a patch PR to adabot that can update the libraries to resolve it
* SpiritBoard project


18:15 @jepler
* Found & fixed DMA bug on RP2040; surprisingly didn’t seem to affect RP2350. When starting a PIO background write, there could be a pending DMA that caused the first background data transmission to be incomplete because it was immediately restarted
* Started documenting CircuitPython Polyphonic Audio FX in Learn, will continue on that
* Will follow up with a monophonic version that tries to match the old Audio FX project as closely as possible


19:39 @snkymkrct (Snakey Maker Cat) -- text only 
* While reorganizing my electronics, I decided to submit a displayio example PR for every sensor board I found. It was fun, I need more sensors!
* I'm also looking at more issues I can help with, and working to publish my first Playground note this week, describing an Adafruit MagTag CircuitPython project.


20:08 @tannewt
* Continuing to work on CircuitMatter.
* Tested with Apple Home.
   * Fixed one issue with encryption and getting the “commissioning complete” command but then failing.
* Tested with matter.js. Gets past commissioning and into discovering what the device is.
* Three picodvi related bugs to look at. (One is Arduino.)
## 21:59 In The Weeds




## 22:09 Wrap-Up
* Next week’s meeting is on Tuesday, October 15, due to a US holiday on Monday.
