## 2:26 Community News
### What’s new in Raspberry Pi Pico 2
In the latest issue of [The MagPi Magazine](https://magpi.raspberrypi.com/issues/145), Raspberry Pi CTO James Adams provides a closer look at what’s new in Raspberry Pi Pico 2 - [Raspberry Pi News](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/whats-new-in-pico-2/).
### DEVELOPING: The Community Discusses RP2350 Pin Latching Issues


The maker community continues to characterize a hardware issue with currently released RP2350 A2 stepping chips. The issue was initially characterized as a problem that can occur if a pin is set as an input with the internal pull-down resistor enabled. If the pin is brought externally to 3.3v, and then the 3.3v is removed, the pin output becomes latched at slightly over 2 volts, instead of being at ground. Raspberry Pi issued [erratum RP2350-E9](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/rp2350/rp2350-datasheet.pdf#page=1341), which discusses this issue and describes a workaround for reading the pin value.


But later reports by Adafruit, Dangerous Prototypes, Pimoroni, and others have shown that enabling the internal pull-down resistor does not seem to be required to trigger the 2V latch-up. Observation also shows that externally grounding the pin with sufficient current clears the latched state. Raspberry Pi and the community are actively investigating this evolving issue, so please refer to the latest developments if the issue affects your designs. - [Raspberry Pi Pico Feedback, issue #401](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-feedback/issues/401)  and [relevant topics in the Raspberry Pi Forum](https://forums.raspberrypi.com/search.php?keywords=rp2350-e9&terms=all&author=&sc=1&sf=all&sr=topics&sk=t&sd=d&st=0&ch=300&t=0&submit=Search).
### 5:24 CircuitPython 9.1.3 Released
CircuitPython 9.1.3 is the latest bugfix release of CircuitPython, and is a new stable release - [Adafruit](https://blog.adafruit.com/2024/08/29/circuitpython-9-1-3-released/) Blog and releases on [GitHub](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases/tag/9.1.3).
Highlights of this release:
* Fix Espressif ESP32-C6 UART creation.
* Adafruit Qualia ESP32-S3 RGB666: fix display tearing.
* Pull request merge builds for stable branches, not just the main branch, are now uploaded to AWS S3.
* Fix Espressif board-specific pin initialization. This fixes board.NEOPIXEL_I2C_POWER initialization on the Adafruit Feather C6.
### 6:29 Is it time to update the Open Hardware Definition for AI or make a parallel one for AI?
It might be time to update the Open Hardware Definition, it’s over 10 years old. A lot has changed in the last 10+ years for open-source hardware and open-source software, and some things have not! There was/is an Open Source Hardware (OSHW) Definition 1.1 draft, but has not been updated on the wiki since December 10, 2018. Phil Torrone has some suggestions - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2024/08/27/is-it-time-to-update-the-open-hardware-definition-for-ai-or-make-a-parallel-one-for-ai/).
> “While there are a few things I’d update on the Open Hardware Definition 1.0 my focus is on adding something to address AI/ChatGPT/humans working with LLMs, etc. I’m going to propose the same thing that I’ve attempted to have the Open Source Initiative consider for their OSI + AI license / definition.

> The goal is sharing which exact tools were used and in what ways to allow others to replicate (and iterate) with AI/LLMs, etc. It’s a little different than commenting code, or publishing code under an open-source license, but the intent can be the same. My addition to the definition is specific to this “freedom”: “Study how the system works and inspect its components.” The OSI + AI definition at this time leaves out the inspection of prompts and data access transparency.”

## 16:12 Hug reports
16:40 @danh (hosting)
* @DangerousPrototypes, @Gadgetoid, and others for helping to characterize the RP2350 latching input issue.
* @jepler for jumping right back in with bug fixes after vacation.
* @samblenny, @RetiredWizard for issue reports and PR’s.


17:23 @foamyguy
* @hathach for fixing an issue I observed with itsy bitsy nrf52840 bootloader and following up to see if it got resolved in the latest versions
* Group Hug


17:47 @jepler
* Group hug
* Hugs for everyone working on bugs blocking 9.2.0, especially anecdata, retiredwizard, dan, scott


18:03 @tannewt
* @AWhetter for quickly fixing the autoapi issue that broke CircuitPython.
* @playduck for updating ESP32-Camera for the new I2C API: https://github.com/espressif/esp32-camera/pull/677
* @hathach for the quick review of the ESP resume fix PR.
* @dcooperdalrymple for making the WM8960 driver much more featureful!
* @EGJ-Moorington for small fixes
## 19:00 Status Updates


19:32 @danh (hosting)
* Released CircuitPython 9.1.3 to publish Feather C6 and Qualia fixes.
* Tracking the RP2350 latching problem. No official word from RPi yet.
* PR reviews, researching various reported issues.
* MicroPython v1.23 merge.


20:43 @foamyguy
* Working on implementing a serial plotter in the Web IDE. Getting close to ready to move the PR out of draft.
* Refactoring vectorio intersection functions that I wrote a few weeks ago into module functions that accept numbers instead of class functions that accept vectorio objects. This removes some chunks of code that are essentially duplicated in the way it was written before. Also adding some for checking whether a shape contains a point and other that will be necessary for the polygon intersection function if I make it far enough to implement that one.


22:14 @jepler
* Trying to pick up some bugs blocking 9.2.0 but the list is actually really short!
* I created a small reproducer for an esp32s3 crashing bug but was unable to isolate the real cause. It sort of looks like it’s inside lwip_accept which would not be fun to debug.
* Out Friday & next Monday to go to Vintage Computer Festival Midwest in the Chicago area (Schaumburg). Anyone in the Chicago area and want to meet me there?


23:41 @tannewt
* Debugged ESP USB sleep resume problem. It is fixed in upstream TinyUSB and I’ll update CP today: https://github.com/hathach/tinyusb/pull/2784 https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/9590
* Debugged autoapi issue that was breaking the RTD build for CP core.
* Updated PIO USB submodule to fix buffer overflow issue
* Bumped Flash and PSRAM speed on qualia back up to 120MHz to reduce tearing.
* Next up is debugging ESP BLE so that BLE HID works. It doesn’t fully connect.
