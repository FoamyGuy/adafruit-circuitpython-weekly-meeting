## 12:48 Hug reports
13:25 @tannewt (host)
* Thanks to Dan for helping debug ESP BLE.
* Thanks to Foamyguy for covering deep dives while I’m out.


13:47 @danh
* @jepler for fixing several infrastructure issues.


14:02 @foamyguy
* @Tyeth for suggesting ideas to try for BLE workflow integration, and pointing me toward a nordic mobile app that makes it easier to troubleshoot BLE integration with the device.
* @Jepler for working on audio streaming support
* Group Hug


14:36 @jepler
* Dan and Tekktrik for PR reviews on the week-end
* Bill88t for spotting a problem with a PR so I could correct it
* @tannewt Thanks for running the meeting!
* Group hug


14:59 @makermelissa
* @danh, @jepler, and @tannewt for your help with figuring out a folder moving issue I was having in CircuitPython.
* Group Hug
## 15:26 Status Updates
15:44 @tannewt (host)
* Mostly out this week.
* Fixing up C6 deep sleep PR.
* Maybe testing iMX RT 1011 PSRAM support.
* Maybe working on iMX RT 106x hardware design.


17:17 @danh
* Seven issues now on 9.1.0 milestone: previously there was just one. While Scott is off I am working on some BLE bugs. Some regression from 9.0.5 on BLE. Want to get iBBQ, heart rate monitor, and BLE UART working. Making progress on fixes but more to do.


18:24 @foamyguy
* Wrote the code for Blinka Says cardboard game, added some fun, but not core functionality like blinking animations, scorekeeping with NVM backed highscore, and tweaking the behavior around losing and starting the next game to make it more likely to follow the users intention by having some “cooldown” timers that ignore inputs for a bit to avoid double pressing. 
* Working on BLE workflow integration for Circup / wwshell. 
   * Got over the first hurdle of the connection immediately closing upon service discovery, and managed to successfully read the Circuitpython and workflow version characteristics
   * Attempted listdir but found that the code seems to get stuck in an infinite loop while attempting to read data from the BLE connection. Reproduced the same issue on a MCU to MCU connection to rule out some problem with Bleak or something else in the PC environment as the issue. Digging further into it this week
* Encountered and documented an issue with the latest bootloader on the itsybitsy nrf52840 and tried a few older versions to find one that was able to successfully load circuitpython on my device
* Following up with requested changes in some of the older PRs to get them ready for merging.
* Update wwshell PR branch to bring in the change to pyproject.toml into it and configure the entry point properly within it


22:10 @jepler
* Wrapped up https mp3 streaming, PR is merged. Will write a guide page on it in the next week or two
* Some updates to our github actions due to the deprecation of macos-11 github runners; new mpy-cross binaries will require a newer macos version. If there’s a way to build a back-compatible version instead please show us how with a PR! I don’t know much about building macos software.
* Weekend: revived some stalled work to reduce the overhead of type annotations in bundle code
   * This saves small amounts of RAM when the mpy files are imported
   * Further work would be needed to “munge” the files when they are frozen in
   * PR is open
* Also weekend: Created a wrapper script to call mpy-cross within circuitpython-build-tools, PR is open
* This week: hopefully wrapping up some of those circuitpython-build-tools library
* Also this week: investigating the espressif zigbee library. It’d be cool if we could “do” zigbee but I don’t understand enough about what zigbee does to even say something smart about it. There’s a C++ esp-idf demo of 2 C6 devices acting as a “light switch” and a “light” and I want to start with making circuitpython able to be the “light” part of the duo. Just before the meeting I did get the demo running on my C6 devkit boards.


25:38 @makermelissa
* Finished up the remaining file operations in the CircuitPython Code Editor over REPL
* Released an updated version of the JavaScript REPL library
* Updated the Code Editor so it automatically loads the current FS API file operations if the root folder of the CircuitPython Device is mounted Read Only and the REPL file operations if it isn’t. 
   * This makes it so that you generally don’t need to worry about dealing with the files being mounted read-only.
* Have a PR in for CircuitPython Code Editor changes
* Out next week and working on GitHub issues for the time being
* Seeing if I can quickly add the [Vivid Unit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5894) to Blinka since the microcontroller has already been added
