## 15:56 Status Updates
16:21 @Liz (hosting)
* I’ve missed the past two meetings because I was trying to get guides done in time for the AAE deadlines. I was able to get the cat thermal printer working properly with the MEMENTO and documented it in a guide that went live last week. I am really excited about this project and am thrilled that I was finally able to get it working thanks to some added delays in the library.
* I’ve also been working on a guide for the new ItsyBitsy ESP32 board. I added a board def to CircuitPython and was able to use it with web workflow.


16:57 @danh
* Publicized MEMENTO update requirement in multiple places.
* Will document and file a new Apple Feedback about the new Sonoma problem of very slow writes for drives <1GB (40x slower!) to add pressure along with the one @eightycc filed.
* Pushed two 9.0.0 issues forward as not urgent (ten remaining after three new ones added).
* Investigating a storage leak on nRF.
* Would like to test some CPX projects with 9.0.0 to see if they are more prone to MemoryErrors. Anyone interested in this?

19:21 @DJDevon3 (text only)
* Received my ST7796S (Featherwing & QT Py BFF) adapter PCB’s. Went on Show & Tell with them. To my knowledge there isn’t a 480x320 TFT BFF like the TFT Featherwing. So I made one and it works great. There are no free pins left on the BFF except RX & TX. The touch display and SD card work. 
* Submitted a 2.5mm matrix panel model to Adafruit_CAD_Parts repo. 
* Currently working on a model for the 5mm pitch matrix panel. Making models available to the public is important for those who want to design their own brackets, stands, or enclosures.

20:04 @foamyguy
   * Submitted PR for initial support of overlay feature in PyCamer library and examples that utilize it for the MEMENTO and was merged last week.
   * Added support for using smaller “sticker” overlay images that aren’t meant to be full sized frames and similar. Hooked up D-Pad buttons to set the location.
   * Added support for customizing the name that is used for photos as they get taken, tested with an example that uses adafruit_ntp to set the internal RTC and then includes timestamps in the photo names
   * Working on infrastructure issues flagged by adabot related to incorrect circup instructions in the readme file.


22:02 @eightycc
   * Continuing work on _bleio for RP2.
   * Investigating #8824 with @argonblue. I believe we’re close to a resolution.


22:28 @jerryn
   * Adapted the AutoFocus code from the PyCamera library to work with the OV5640 breakout boards I have been using with a metro esp32s3 and feather esp32s3.
   * Began working on a combined RFM library to handle both the RFM69 and RFM9x modules.  It likely will not be able to run on the feather M0 boards, but it seemed like a good idea since there is a lot of common (or could be)  code between them.
   * There is an open issue for discussion of this in the RFM9x repo and a link to it from the RFM69 repo. Feel free to comment with suggestions for improvement. The first goal is to not break anything….then to add features.
   * Should this be a “Community” library or an Adafruit library? Name? Is CIrcuitPython RFM or Adafruit CircuitPython RFM OK? 
   * Hoping to clear out existing issues in the RFM69 and RFM9x libraries as I work through the new library. I closed a few issues that did not appear to be actual issues with the library. I expect they will get reopened if I was too aggressive.


25:53 @Justin (text only)
   * Got ConnectionManager in the bundle and frozen onto boards that need it
   * Opened a few PRs that use legacy “set_socket” methods that needed to be merged before the changes to Requests is
   * The PR to Requests is set and ready for final review (removed old socket code, updated all examples and got code coverage to 85%)
   * Random fact: so far 11 PRs have been opened to make this change (8 are merged)


26:22 @makermelissa
   * Fixed an issue with the CircuitPython Code Editor where it was refusing to connect via Web Workflow
   * Worked on writing a MEMENTO guide with Web Workflow, but ran into a bug where SD cards couldn’t be used remotely
   * For the time being, am working on GitHub issues
   * Will then switch back to working on Pi Eyes


27:04 @tannewt
   * Roof repair and sick kid may distract me this week a bit.
   * Fixed SSLSocket binding
   * Fixed PWMOut crash and standardize PWM related classes to using finaliser only.
   * Working on USB host bugs but need Thach’s feedback to finish them.
   * 9.0.0 bugs!


28:20 @tekktrik (not present)
   * Past week
   * Released my new “circfirm” CLI tool, which aims to allow updating CircuitPython firmware for boards from the terminal.  It was inspired by circup and also an issue where many boards had to be updated for the PyCon sprints.
   * This week
   * Continue to improve circfirm
   * Prepare my other tool, circlink (auto-syncing/pushing code from local directory to board), for updates including cross platform usage
   * I’d love to make some small tweaks to how adabot calculates library downloads.  “pypistats” is a library that removes the dependence on performing BigQuery updates manually.
   * Forever busy with grad school, but please don’t hesitate to ping me in Discord regarding issues I can help with (I likely will not see them otherwise)


## 29:12 In The Weeds
   * 29:35 Began working on a combined RFM library to handle both the RFM69 and RFM9x modules.  It likely will not be able to run on the feather M0 boards, but it seemed like a good idea since there is a lot of common (or could be)  code between them.
   * There is an open issue for discussion of this in the RFM9x repo and a link to it from the RFM69 repo. Feel free to comment with suggestions for improvement. The first goal is to not break anything….then to add features.
   * Should this be a “Community” library or an Adafruit library? Name? Is CIrcuitPython RFM or Adafruit CircuitPython RFM OK?
