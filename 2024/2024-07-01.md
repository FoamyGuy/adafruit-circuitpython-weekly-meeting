## 02:46 Community News
### 02:52 Feather of the Day Launched
Feather of the Day celebrates the Adafruit Feather ecosystem of programmable boards. Each day a new Feather board will be highlighted - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/category/feather-of-the-day/)
### 03:01 The Bootloader
A monthly podcast loading you up with news, project updates, and product talk from the CircuitPython and maker communities. Hosted by Paul Cutler and Tod Kurt.
In the July 1st episode, Paul Cutler and Tod Kurt discuss new tutorial videos from Professor John Gallaugher about using CircuitPython with PyCharm and how to use circup to update CircuitPython libraries. In addition to other topics, the show also includes an interview with Justin Myers, the author of the new CircuitPython library, ConnectionManager - [The Bootloader](https://thebootloader.net/)
### 03:36 Project of the Week: The SPOKE Capacitive Touch Board
Tom Fox's SPOKE board is an easy way to add up to 26 touch sensors to projects for interaction. Anything with capacitive potential can be connected to the pins and used to control computer inputs. Create your own USB MIDI device, game controller, key mapper or other computer interface device by attaching metallic objects, conductive inks, conductive threads, fruits, plants, vegetables, cutlery, car keys, mushrooms etc. or use it as a standalone device. The custom circuit board houses a Raspberry Pi Pico. USB MIDI and keyboard are accommodated via CircuitPython code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Tom-Vulpes/Spoke/tree/main) - [Project Website](https://www.spokeboard.com/), [YouTube](https://youtu.be/8bxbrVFYZEk), and [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2024/06/26/a-capacitive-touch-board-for-the-raspberry-pi-pico/)
### 04:26 Newsletter Details
The Python on Microcontrollers Weekly Newsletter is a CircuitPython-community-run newsletter emailed every Monday. The complete archives are [here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/).

## 12:25 Hug reports
12:43 @Liz (hosting)
* @Jepler for discovering the CI issues in the Learn repo and assisting with fixes
* Group hug


12:55 @CGrover (text only)


* @DJDevon3 for exploring the frontiers of APIs and documenting his journey in Adafruit Playground. Has been very helpful for the conversion from openweathermap.org to weather.gov’s NWS API.


13:16 @danh
* @Snakey Maker Cat, for their extensive help in discord. They are now a discord helper.


13:50 @DJDevon3 (text only)
* @Trevor for the new It’s A Snap iOS AdafruitIO mobile app. 
* @Deshipu, @Todbot, @Elpekenin, and @Bear for helping me with a displayio.Group object syntax issue in discord. It was user error but I still want to blame the object for not accepting a list. 😆
* @Group Hug


14:12 @foamyguy
* @JonnyBergdahl for sharing a great idea of a way to check if a file exists by requesting 0 bytes of its content with a read file command in the BLE workflow
* @Paul Cutler for discord moderation
* @Deshipu for sharing a neat technique for rotating bitmaps efficiently
* Group Hug


14:55 @jepler
* Dan for helping so many people on the -dev channel, PRs and issues
* Justin for some quick feedback on my somewhat rambling adafruit_requests issue about direct access to the socket object


15:19 @makermelissa
* Dan for testing the updated CircuitPython Code Editor
* Group Hug


15:33 @tannewt
* Paul Cutler for deleting discord spam and banning the user.
* Randall Scharpf for the PR to add SPI target support.
* Snakey Maker Cat for joining @discord-helpers and @danh for suggesting them.
## 16:13 Status Updates
16:37 @Liz (hosting)
* Most of last week I worked on the board design for the ESP32-S2 Ikea Vindriktning drop in board. They are already in Boston as of this morning and should be arriving tomorrow
* I’ve also been working on a product guide for the new Feather RP2040 Adalogger. This is another RP2040 “bones” board with a microSD card slot on the back


17:04 @CGrover (text only)
* Working to improve wifi/internet reliability on an ESP32-S2 for feeding AIO from various APIs, primarily the extremely free weather.gov data (no account or key required) . Incorporating automatic AIO feed throttling has helped tremendously. Have seen a few 40+ hour non-interrupted sessions. When it does fail, the code automatically recovers thanks to advice from all the try-except examples out there. In the process of writing up a weather.gov how-to Playground note.


17:41 @danh
* Working on one remaining Espressif BLE bug.
* Looking at the other remaining 9.1.0 bugs.


18:16 @DJDevon3 (text only)
* Pushed a PR updating the Rachio API example to only use 1 request instead of 2. This allows 1700 requests per day instead of 850. 
* Still working on a Rachio touch screen menu project. I love playing with GUI’s and API’s.


18:36 @foamyguy
* Mostly working on BLE workflow integration for circup / wwshell. Completed downloading files, and uploading files this week. Thought I had mkdir working, but it’s stuck in an infinite loop after it creates the directory. Working on uploading directories today, aiming for an implementation that re-uses the same bleak Client connection for creating all directories and uploading all files rather than disconnect / reconnect for every command.
* Reviewing library PRs and a small fix for the bundle repo.
* Filling in on Deep Dive this Friday


20:09 @jepler
* Short week – out tuesday, thursday, friday
* Working on a guide for mp3 playback including streaming. Will also cover the question of “which MCUs work for mp3s”
   * Still need to test OG esp32 to see if it works
* Realized I need an official, supported way to get the socket object for a http/https request, filed a PR to make support for the non-standard “socket” property of Response objects in adafruit_requests officially supported by us


21:46 @makermelissa
* Last 2 weeks:
   * Out for Vacation last week
   * Finished up changes to CircuitPython code Editor
   * Started working on Guide for USB Workflow
   * Need to fix a couple of things that are broken for folks


22:14 @tannewt
* Short week for me. Out Thursday and Friday. Also recovering from being sick.
* Circling back to Stemma G0 work. Thinking about multi-controller I2C to have devices tell CP when values change instead of polling.
