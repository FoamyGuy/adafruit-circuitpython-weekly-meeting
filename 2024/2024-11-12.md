## \#\# 12:13 Hug reports

12:30 @Liz (hosting)

* Group hug


12:40 @anecdata (text only)

* @jepler for the quick rp2350 ssl fix, and for the PR review

12:50 @foamyguy

* Justin Cooper for making a change in learn bundling to handle an issue from github that I looked into  
* @jepler for making the unix port testing easier by adding defaults to the make commands.  
* @Shubham0x13 for submitting more fixes to Display\_Text library  
* Group hug

## \#\# 13:24 Status Updates

13:49 @Liz (hosting)

* I’ve been working on a CircuitPython video synth with the Feather RP2350 and HSTX to DVI output. I am using a PDM mic as an audio input and am doing some FFT math to create some spectrum analyzer style animations.   
* Yesterday I took the holiday and spent time getting my Playstation 2 to work with open playstation loader. This homebrew software lets you play Playstation 2 game ISO files via network storage. I have been battling my PS2 for a few months trying to fix its disc reader and finally decided to go this route.

15:05 @foamyguy

* Looked into and submitted fixes for an infinite hang issue in bme680 and a config mode issue in bno055 drivers  
* Submitted improvements to docs based on open issues in ImageLoad and CLUE libraries  
* Updated the artifact actions versions used in all Adafruit repos  
* Added howto instruction links to learn guide pages for the remaining Adafruit boards without them  
* Created a TextBox widget for the DisplayText library. It allows you to constrain the width and height of the box and will automatically wrap text to fit within the given size. It supports aligning the text to left, right or center.
