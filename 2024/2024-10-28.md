### Supercon 8 Badge Holds Six Add-ons and Runs MicroPython

Hackaday Supercon 8 will be held November 1-3 in California. Their conference badge this year is a homage to the “SAO” (simple add-on), a conference badge add-on “standard” created in 2017 by Hackaday’s Brian Benchoff. The badge this year holds 6 SAOs and runs MicroPython for I2C interaction goodness – Hackaday.

## 15:08 Hug reports
@jepler (host)
* Group hug
* The folks working on audio effects module


15:46 @danh
* Thanks to **everyone** who helped get CircuitPython 9.2.0 to completion.
* @FoamyGuy many improvements to circuitpython.org. @johnnohj for button layout idea.
* @bill88t for finding a last-minute RP2350 PSRAM issue, which was fixed in 9.2.0 final.
* @gamblor21, @dcooperdalrymple, @todbot, @jepler for audio effects work


17:00 @foamyguy
* @jepler for adding vectorio capability to the unix port
* @ralphtheninja1 twitch user who helped correct some code and learn guide content I was working on during a stream
* @johnnohj for sharing ideas on the installation instructions button placement
* Group hug
## 17:59 Status Updates
18:27 @jepler (host)
* Some finishing touches to TM1814 CircuitPython module including setting default current to lowest instead of highest, & supporting an inverted output mode
* Also working on some stuff in Arduino related to floppies
* Will put in a change to make the build stop if the specified version of gcc is not present
   * Per-port?
   * Doing this because I got a non-running firmware for rp2350 built by gcc 10 locally
* Have a weird situation where my rp2350 feather with soldered PSRAM can’t enter bootloader mode by holding boot + pressing reset, but it WILL enter bootloader mode if I plug in while holding boot. … HOW?
   * I’ll stick the same FW on a non-PSRAM rp2350 feather and see if the same thing happens
   * Reset button without boot works, resets into circuitpython


20:18 @danh
* I released CIrcuitPython 9.2.0 this morning. 9.2.0-rc.0 was last Thursday. I fixed one bug, to fix PSRAM on RP2350, and there were a couple of other very minor changes.
* Onward to CircuitMatter!


21:40 @foamyguy
* Submitted fix for an issue with the display button library that was reported by a user on discord
* Started working on a learn guide detailing how to make custom Animations for use with adafruit_led_animation library. Learned a lot about how it works, and have implemented a few new animations to use as examples. Also have a few more complex ones in mind, maybe an implementation of conway’s?
* Addressed issues from circuitpython-org repo:
   * Fix issue with language choice for pre-release version
   * Added castellated pads to the feature list for filtering
   * Make the manufacturers filter list shorter and scrollable
   * Show the filterable features on the board download page
   * Add How to Install button that can link to a learn guide or 3rd party instructions
   * Swapped UF2 button to appear above the BIN button when both are available
* Deep Dive on Friday
## 26:04 In The Weeds
@foamyguy - circuitpython-org adding a check to ensure board_id matches the .md filename https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython-org/issues/1012 

How strictly would we want to enforce the check? & What to do about devices that are currently mismatched? Make exceptions for them? Update either the board_id or filename to make them match? 


We should redirect to the new name if we do rename the file, or change the id.


Try to find out if the template language supports getting the name of the md file, and if so use this instead of having board_id ‘manually’ declared in the metadata.


Would we want to also check that board_id matches a board in the core repo?
