* @justin for continuing fixes for network libraries.
* @UnexpectedMaker for noting that ESP32-C6 was missing as a ported chip in the CircuitPython release notes. (ESP32-C2 was also missing.).


13:28 @DJDevon3 (text only)
* Group hug


13:34 @foamyguy
* @sjev on github for working on switching circup to use pyproject.toml instead of setup.py
* @justin for continued effort on network related improvements and fixes
* Group hug


14:07 @jepler (probably missing meeting)
* Group hug
* Hugs for everyone I saw at PyCon US! Including KeithTheEE, ntoll, deshipu & tekktrik


14:19 @Justin
* Group hug
* @danh for continued support in my networking/socket/mqtt fixes


14:50 @makermelissa
* @danh for helping me figure out raw-paste mode with CircuitPython and giving me a bunch of resources
* @jepler for representing us at PyCon
* Group Hug


15:14 @Tyeth (Text Only)
* Big hug for Justin and Dan, taking a deep look into the MQTT and connection timeout issues arising from ESP32 on the PyPortal Titano, then smashing out a fix and new beta.
* Big Hug for Melissa, thanks for quickly addressing the web-editor css breakpoint issue, along with working on it generally at the moment, and Scott for review/merge


15:41 @todbot (text only)
* @danh & @jepler for re-reminding me about `PICO_XOSC_STARTUP_DELAY_MULTIPLIER 64` for custom RP2040 boards not recognizing their flash chips
* @deshipu, @jepler, @jedgarpark for interesting discussion of potential sequencer for synthio
* Group hug!
## 16:11 Status Updates
16:38 @Liz (hosting)
* Last week I wrapped up the code for the YBox3. I was able to get three different channels working consistently on the Pico W with DVI output in Arduino. Noe is designing a case for it and after that I’ll wrap up the guide
* I’ve been working on a few product guides. This morning I published the TRRS Trinkey guide. Bill Binko of AT Makers will be adding more demos to the guide in the future that will be more demonstrative of the ways the board can be used.
* Currently I’m in the middle of the Pixel Trinkey guide. On Friday, right before the long weekend I got a build working in Arduino to utilize the built-in dynamic lighting in Windows 11 with the Trinkey. What I didn’t realize initially in my testing before having the hardware was that to use the Microsoft HID library you need to use the Arduino SAMD BSP instead of the Adafruit SAMD BSP so I have a “hacked” build locally. I’ll provide UF2’s in the guide for this but more importantly and pertinent to this meeting is that I’ll have CircuitPython support for it so folks don’t need to futz around with the Arduino stuff.


18:13 @danh
* Released CircuitPython 9.0.5 and 9.1.0-beta.3 last week.
* Addressed several outstanding 9.x.x bugs. Some were already fixed, some ended up being support issues. Testing various network issues.
* Continuing to work through 9.x.x issues




19:40 @DJDevon3 (text only)
* My iPhone 5 SE spontaneously caught fire while charging on my bed. No major damage other than a bed spread.  Please don’t leave charging phones unsupervised.
* Helped test the ESP32-S2 last week.  The new fixes allow for multiple SSL connections just like the S3 does now.  Someone might want to glance through the learn guides that use the S2 to ensure they work with the new connection manager. S2’s are working great again.
* Haven’t done much coding this week. Have done a lot of yard maintenance and digging trenches for new irrigation lines.


20:20 @foamyguy
* Finishing touches on the new pages for Circup usage in the learn guide
* Working on a few small fixes in circup to specific usages of some of the –path option
* Continued work on wwshell (wireless workflow shell) CLI tool for managing files via web workflow. Moved my existing work into circup, got all basic commands except for delete are implemented. Need to go through pylint errors then will submit PR.
* Testing several old releases of CircuitPython to find where behavior changed in the core that caused animations on the FlipInput widget to break.


23:45 @jepler (probably missing meeting)
* Last week: PyCon!
   * Delivered my talk about converting old input devices to USB HID with CircuitPython & demoed the keyboards after in the hallway track
   * Performed 2 short duets on stage with Sumana Harihareswara during her closing keynote speech (thanks to a chance encounter with her on thursday night)
   * Videos for PyCon US 2024 will be released sometime this summer. It’s sure to get a mention in the newsletter when it happens
   * While waiting in airports, I wrote some code for sequencing with synthio, but reviewers felt it wasn’t pleasant to use and didn’t fill the use cases we wanted, so that’s shelved for now
      * This also points at the “change” method of the synthesizer having poor ergonomics
* This week:
   * MP3 decoding from a socket, probably
      * It was sort of working before pycon, but playback would stop unexpectedly
      * Have to play weird tricks with the socket blocking/timeout settings, which is unsatisfactory
      * Has weird interaction with requests
      * works with “complete mp3 files” but fails at soma.fm style continuous MP3 streams


24:59 @Justin
* Continued with MiniMQTT updates (and it’s wrappers AzureIot and AWS_IOT)
* Found out ESP32SPI can only handle 1 active SSL socket - made the error clear
* Added 2 playground notes:
   * https://adafruit-playground.com/u/justmobilize/pages/socketpoollogger
   * https://adafruit-playground.com/u/justmobilize/pages/get-radio




26:25 @makermelissa
* Out sick for a few days during the past couple of weeks, but finally starting to feel better now
* Added some more missing boards to circuitpython.org
* Working on CircuitPython Code Editor and adding improved file operations
   * Currently finishing up implementing Raw-Paste mode which is designed for programs to use the REPL, so there’s less chatter on the serial terminal
   * This may allow even micropython boards to work with the Code Editor as well as provide a more consistent experience with USB connected devices
## 27:27 In The Weeds
27:46 @foamyguy - Do we want .devcontainer files (for dev environment in VSCode) checked in to repos? https://github.com/adafruit/circup/pull/214
