## 16:31 Hug reports
16:50 @foamyguy (hosting)
* @RetiredWizard for looking into an issue with some types of PNG images getting skewed and distorted by the ImageLoad library and submitting a fix
* @deshipu for looking into the same issue and reviewing
* @JP for trying out the Spirit Board project and offering some great feedback
* @Jepler for reviewing some changes to the screenshot utility


17:21 @danh
* @tannewt for all the work on CircuitMatter, and for discussions about it.
* @foamyguy for taking on new responsibilities, including updating circuitpython.org.


17:52 @jepler
* Hug for @foamyguy, it’s nice to see you puting in more time on CircuitPython stuff!
* @tannwt best wishes for you & your family. We’ll keep the lights on for when you come back
* @deshipu enjoyed seeing your hardware posts on mastodon lately


18:29 @tannewt
* @lboue (Ludovic) who has been testing and refining CircuitMatter.
## 19:00 Status Updates
19:30 @foamyguy (hosting)
* Learn the process for submitting new devices to circuitpython.org and submitted PRs to add all of the current crop of “unknown” ones
* Working on the remaining shape intersection functions. Down to just 1 function to implement and then some cleanup
* Setup the [MatrixPortal Spooky Eyes](https://learn.adafruit.com/matrix-portal-creature-eyes) project and used the expanded RAM on the S3 Matrixportal to update it to allow cycling through the different eyes with the buttons instead of having to hardcode the configuration


20:44 @danh
* Zero or one issue left for CircuitPython 9.2.0, so we can do an rc.0 soon. I fixed some more things and there are a few PR’s left.
* Getting set up for CircuitMatter testing and development: Needed a device with a Thread border router: Apple TV 4K with Ethernet has one (note that the cheaper one without Ethernet does not). I have several other Amazon and Google devices that are Matter-compatible, but they are older versions without a border router. Good listing here: https://www.evehome.com/en-us/hub.


22:48 @jepler
* Created CircuitPython monophonic Audio FX and wrote a guide page about it. This program is intended to allow easy migration from the VS1000-based Audio FX board from Adafruit.
* TM1814 LED library added to the bundle
   * Some enhancements incoming
   * Will write up a short guide on them
   * I kinda hate them: Whenever your code is NOT running, they flash an annoying test pattern and there’s nothing you can do about it besides cutting power.
   * The string I got has 1 TM1814 for every 3 LED packages which will be a surprise for people used to neopixels
   * But they’re awful bright and run on 12V
* After that, back to Arduino code for the Floppsy floppy board
* For fun, I made something cursed: directly invoke a LLM when building your C/C++ projects by simply using a `#include` directive! https://social.afront.org/deck/@stylus/113336087391576927


25:14 @tannewt
* Baby is due in a week! So, this is likely my last week of work. Taking four weeks off initially.
* More CircuitMatter progress.
   * State is saved and restored so commissioning is only needed once.
   * All certificates and initial state are generated if the state file is missing. Examples no longer depend on external project-chip repo for test certs.
   * Packaged on PyPI with correct dependencies.
   * Getting blink working on Pi Zero 2W. Then will do neopixel/RGBW lights.
   * Filed issues with outstanding TODO items: https://github.com/adafruit/circuitmatter/issues
