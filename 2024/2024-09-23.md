## 17:55 Hug reports
18:22 @foamyguy (hosting)
* Group Hug
* Paul cutler posting newsletter links 


18:35 @danh
* @tannewt for doing most of the ESP-IDF I2C driver update already


19:05 @tannewt
* @foamyguy for debugging the community bundle build failure.
* @RetiredWizard for adding SDIO support for ESP. Also for two board tweaks that use settings.toml to configure for board variants.
## 19:47 Status Updates
20:18 @foamyguy (hosting)
* Implemented fixes and submitted PRs to resolve all open issues with the library and guide screenshot utility
* Worked on the shape intersection functions, have polygon circle check working along with the more primitive checks that are used within it.
* Looking into an issue with Community Bundle
* Try to make circuitpython-build-tool more forgiving of failed builds for 3rd party bundles.


21:59 @danh
* Released CircuitPython 9.1.4 and 9.2.0-beta.0. They share a number of bug fixes.
* Updating CIrcuitPython to use the new I2C driver in ESP-IDF. We can now do this because the esp32-camera library was updated to use the new driver (though it’s expecting ESP-IDF v5.4, and we’re on v5.3.1). The update appears to fix several I2C issues we’ve been seeing. Scott did most of this work a while ago: I took that branch, fixed a few things, and am now getting the camera code to work.
* 9.2.0 is getting close: we are down to only a few issues.


24:15 @tannewt
* Continuing on CircuitMatter. Fixed some encoding issues. Commissioner thinks one of my path structs is incomplete. Slow and steady progress.
