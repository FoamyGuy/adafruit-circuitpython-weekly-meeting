## 11:15 Hug reports
11:31 @Liz (hosting)
* @danh for running the meeting last week while I was still recovering from Covid
* @tannewt for fixing BLE HID
* Group hug


11:44 @danh
* Raspberry Pi folks for revision of RP2350-E9 erratum
* @todbot for touchio discussions


12:08 @foamyguy
* Group hug


12:18 @makermelissa
* @tannewt for fixing the tinyuf2 AWS issue
* @liz for testing out the Code Editor fixes
* Group Hug


12:39 @Mark[Gamblor] (missing)
* @Jepler for providing me information and discussion about how synthio works and some ideas on audio effects processing
* @todbot and @tannewt for ideas on an API for audio effects


12:53 @SamBlenny (text only)
* Thanks to @tannewt and @MakerMelissa for ESP32 bug fixes


13:00 @tannewt
* Bwhitman for starting the ESP32-P4 port.
## 13:17 Status Updates
13:39 @Liz (hosting)
* I had Covid for the first time so I am just getting back to work since the end of last week
* I am working on a project that uses an ESP32-S3 with one of the new RS232 breakouts. I’m using the Bluefruit Connect app to send RS232 messages. This guide will hopefully be wrapped up this week
* I’ve also been working on documenting the QT Py CH32V203. This is another one of those weird WCH chips. Huge thanks to Thach for putting in a lot of work to TinyUSB and the WCH arduino board support package to make using the board a lot easier. He also assisted me with troubleshooting my own toolchain setup which I really appreciated.


14:38 @danh
* MicroPython v1.23 merge is well along. Multiple ports compile and pass smoke tests. Fixing frozen modules. Then I’ll try the test suite and debug if necessary.
* As everybody knows, RPi revised the RP2350-E9 erratum. It’s much better now. I made an issue asking whether pico-sdk is going to support the workarounds. We decided to turn off touchio for now since using a pull-up instead of a pull-down is non-standard for touchio. We will also not implement the workaround described in the erratum to read a pin with a weak or no pull-down. Instead we’ll recommend that people just avoid the issue by using a strong pull-down or use a pull-up. “If it hurts don’t do that.” I’ll write cautionary notes for the CircuitPython documentation.
* Shepherded some PR’s through. Maybe we should go ahead with 9.2.0-alpha.2352 and not wait for the merge work to finish. When the merge is done, we can release 9.2.0-beta.0.


19:04 @foamyguy
* Some library PR reviews and testing
* Investigated a syntax oddity that caused mpy-cross to fail and found a suitable alternative syntax
* Implemented a few more of the intersection functions that would be needed for polygon intersection.
* Writing up “Blinka Says” game inspired by Simon into a Learn Guide
* Wrap up the serial plotter PR enough to get it out of draft for feedback
* Outside CircuitPython, started working through picoCTF (https://picoctf.org/) practices from their backlog. They host a yearly CTF competition with prizes for students but after the competition concludes the CTF challenges are available to anyone who signs up for a free account.


20:45 @jepler (missing meeting) 
* Rp2350 support for new pio features is in progress 
* Changes in pioasm look complete
* Will need changes in StateMachine constructor to set new HW registers 


21:03 @makermelissa
* Unsuccessfully worked on trying to fix the tinyuf2 GitHub actions
* Fixed the WebSerial ESPTool for the ESP32-S3
* Also fixed the Release Drafter for that repo
* Continued working on creating a Home Assistant Integration for Adafruit IO


21:45 @mark[gamblor] (missing)
* Working on adding a base for audio effects (issue #8974) proof of concept
* Looking for any feedback on the issue, ideas, suggestions, concerns, etc.
* This will as time permits will continue to develop a working proof of concept


22:06 @tannewt
* News!
* Fixed BLE descriptors on ESP32 so BLE HID works now.
* Debugged Feather RP2350 issue. It was the same as the crystal startup issue on RP2040.
* Continued bwhitman’s P4 work. USB doesn’t come up yet. I poked Espressif about it so I’m not going to do it.
* Hit I2C issue that is blocking the release so will look at that a bit.
* Will PR an update to ESP IDF 5.3.1 today.
* Get back to CircuitMatter this week.
