### 3:05 A New Raspberry Pi OS Update Arrives with Linux Kernel 6.1 LTS
A new Raspberry Pi OS update has arrived with the release of Linux Kernel 6.1. This is the first update to the official operating system for Raspberry Pi devices in 3 months and is notable for being the first version powered by the [Linux 6.1](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2022/12/linux-kernel-6-1-released-new-features) LTS kernel (previous versions use Linux 5.15 LTS). The newer kernel offers improved hardware support, new drivers, performance boosts, and better security. Gamers will appreciate the addition of new gamepad drivers. 


The Raspberry Pi OS 2023-05-03 update also features updated software, including Chromium 113, Mathematic 13.2.1, Matlab 23.1.0, and Raspberry Pi Imager 1.7.4 and big updates to libcamera, libcamera-apps (including improved thumbnail rendering), and picamera2 (including EXIF date and time tags) - [omgLinux](https://www.omglinux.com/raspberry-pi-os-update-may-2023/) and [RaspberryPi.com Downloads](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/).

## 24:16 Status Updates
24:29 @tannewt (hosting)
* Spent most of the week on CircuitPyrate (a CP reimplementation of Bus Pirate). Also added a prompt_toolkit CP port. It manages up arrow history and entry editing.
* Continuing on it this week.
* Need to fix SSD1681 EPD as well because I have screens now.
* Pimoroni Inky Frame is staring at me wanting to have a CP board def and show me the weather.
* Ordered a pico-ice which is a RP2040 + ICE40. Interested in some FPGA goodness.


26:11 @DJDevon3 (text only)
* Workshop lamp PCB’s arrived. Unfortunately I mixed up diameter with radius during a design change and never noticed. Now I have a 19” ring instead of a 9.5” ring. Getting supplies this week to turn it into an illuminated lazy susan.
*   * 3D printed an FPV camera mount for an RC car. Been a lot of fun to play with in the yard. Learning a lot about RC lately in an attempt to shrink the sewer bot even smaller.
* Got a very slimmed down version of my offline weather station running on the Feather RP2040 DVI. Unfortunately when attempting to use it with Airlift featherwing for pulling online data ran into memory allocation issues. Same thing attempting to run GifIO. There’s not much RAM left after DVI gets through with it. It’s a good start, thank you to the developers working on this. It’s cool to see Circuit Python on an HDMI monitor.




27:35 @foamyguy
   * PR Reviews, still working through the influx from PyCon, but making good progress, only ones remaining have been responded to and are awaiting further changes or action.
   * Created a more advanced HTTPServer example that uses 14x4 segment, and Neopixel featherwings and allows the user to manipulate scrolling text on the segments and colors or animations displayed on the neopixels. Interested in extracting the neopixel portion of it out and making a standard-ish REST API for interacting with Neopixels or DotStars.
   * Added non-blocking marquee functionality to the library that interfaces with 14x4 segments
   * Going back through github pages and adabot reports to tabulate stats and lists of PyCon related contributions 
   * Submit a PR to change colorsys library to match the CPYthon API more closely.


30:00 @jepler
   * Syntho tremolo & vibrato are ready for review
   * Next items for synthio might include…
   * Noise waveforms are an obvious thing missing
   * Filtering (FIR) - arm cmsis has an FIR toolkit
   * Jp discovered that midi in isn’t working, at least in 8.1 beta & metro m7. I reproduced it and will at least bisect it. Liz offered to test on pico, to see if it’s board-specific
   * May do micropython 1.20 merge after discussion w/ scott & dan
   * May start looking at a better I/O & data processing block system, would start with just a sketch of how the API would look
   * Other stuff: re-capping power supplies for my Xerox 820 machine, which gave up its magic smoke last week (sigh)


33:46 @Jose David(Text Only)
   * Finally got some time to install CircuitPython in the LilygoWatch that Neradoc added support to. Learned a lot of stuff including Web workflow. Not sure who was involved in that, but I think is great. Worked in the Bosch BMA423 CircuitPython support as this is the accelerometer that the Lilygo 
Need to read some more “datasheets” to add the step counting feature. 
   * Added CircuitPython support for the LPS28, BMP581 sensors


34:26 @kattni
   *  Last week:
   * RFM95 guide in moderation
   * Friday and over the weekend: Canary nightlight code
   * Ran into a possible issue in the core, or something, but I think my code is running consistently at the moment
   * This week:
   * Work with Jeff to maybe sort out the core bug
   * Moderate Liz’s guide
   * Go through the USB Host guide fixes, and apply them to my recent Feather RP2040 guides because they are definitely present there as well
   * Various misc guide updates


37:29 @MakerMelissa
   * Last Week:
   * Worked on catching up on messages
   * Started working on a PR for a collab project that I’m working on with Erin, which is a storybook that will generate unlimited stories for you, but was running into issues
   * Added a large batch of new CircuitPython Boards and a few Blinka boards to circuitpython.org
   * Merged a large PR into the CircuitPython Code Editor and fixed an issue where it wasn’t loading on boards.
   * This Week:
   * Adding a bunch more Blinka boards
   * Finishing up my PR for my collab project
   * Work on some of the GitHub issues I had been putting off related to PlatformDetect, Blinka, and the Raspberry Pi Installer Scripts.


38:33 @Paul Cutler
   * New episode of The CircuitPython show today with Ben Shockley.  Ben is the creator of the Mini Fig boards, Lego mini-figure sized dev boards.
   * All this talk of synthio has rekindled my interest in playing music, so I bought a MIDI keyboard controller that arrived this weekend


39:04 @todbot (lurking, hopefully)
   * Synthio algorithmic composition fun w/ LFOs & amp envelope on QTPy RP2040: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Ke9RMHf1E
   * Noticed `busio.UART` on CirPy8.1 Metro M7 requires `timeout=0.0001` parameter otherwise `adafruit_midi` fails to receive. Working on creating a succinct bug report to characterize issue.
   * Not CirPy but: Arduino version of PicoStepSeq sequencer now has rock-solid syncing & sourcing MIDI clock, and USB-MIDI to Serial-MIDI forwarding


40:10 @tekktrik (not present)
   * Last week
   * My parents were in town so nothing in the world of CircuitPython
   * This week
   * Taking a look at my backlog of assigned issues and starting to tackle them
## 40:30 In The Weeds
40:56 @foamyguy Type Annotations questions:
   * Usage of assert lines to make some of the more strict mypy warnings and errors happy. I think this will add size to the libraries unlike type annotations, so it’s worth considering where we fall on tradeoff between size on device vs. making the checking tooling happier
        https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_DisplayIO_Layout/pull/85/files#diff-d3bf5a509291f5ad5af3161599c50c03df8d1bb1b592e6d4159e54662afaa56eR620


   * (tekktrik) I assume this is different than things like bounds checking (e.g. if x < 0: throw ValueError), but just wanted to ask.
   * (foamyguy) Yes different from bounds. These ones are asserting not None, added a link to the place change in question.
   * (tekktrik) Does adding the assert statements mask a different problem (e.g., type juggling) or is adding asserts just necessary for this level of complexity?
   * (foamyguy) Perhaps type juggling, im not familiar with the term, some variables get set to None in __init__ but later get value put into them before being acted upon. Without the asserts mypy strict raises warnings or errors about it.
   * 44:58 Color Alias in circuitpython typing: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Display_Button/pull/37#discussion_r1181602742 we have one that covers tuple and hex int, but it’s inside led.py. Is it okay to use this in contexts other than LEDs like displayio? Or do we want to make a more generic one elsewhere within circuitpython_typing?


48:34 @cater RP2040 zero length I2C write behavior. Related to this issue/pr: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Nunchuk/pull/34


55:53 @makermelissa Blinka tested OS question:
   * With Blinka, as boards are added, there isn’t a great way for users to know which OS the boards were tested with. For boards like Raspberry Pi, this is pretty easy, but for instance, some of the Orange Pi boards were originally added with Armbian, but there is at least one other distro of Debian that runs on it.
   * I was considering adding a Markdown doc that people can add to, but wondered if others had other ideas.
   * Probable solution:
   * Use circuitpython.org to track the tested OS
   * Point users to circuitpython.org via the readme
   * Add a PR template that asks which OS the board was with
