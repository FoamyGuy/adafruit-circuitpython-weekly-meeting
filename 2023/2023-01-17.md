### 03:02  CircuitPython in 2023: Let the Devs Know Your Feelings!
 CircuitPython in 2023 

As the year starts, the CircuitPython development team would like to take some time to share their goals for CircuitPython in 2023 and beyond. Just like past years (full summary [2019](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/01/28/circuitpython-in-2019/), [2020](https://blog.adafruit.com/2020/02/03/circuitpython2020-recap/), [2021](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/02/16/circuitpython2021-round-up/), and [2022](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/02/01/thank-you-for-circuitpython2022/)), they’d like everyone in the Python on hardware community to contribute by posting their thoughts to a public place on the internet by Wednesday January 18th, 2023.
Here are a few ways to post:
* a video on YouTube
* a post on the CircuitPython forum
* a blog post on your site
* a post on Mastodon with tags #CircuitPython and #CircuitPython2023
* a Gist on GitHub
They want to hear from you. When you post, please add #CircuitPython2023 and email circuitpython2023@adafruit.com to let them know about your post so they can post it on the Adafruit Blog.
The post can cover any topic related to CircuitPython. See a suggested list and more in the post on the [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2023/01/01/circuitpython-in-2023-circuitpython2023-circuitpython/). This includes any suggestions or comments related to this newsletter.
### 04:13 What to expect from the Raspberry Pi Foundation in 2023
The Raspberry Pi Foundation has written an article on what to expect from them in 2023 - Raspberry Pi.
### 04:21 Project of the Week: Castle in the Sky Laputa Stone
Castle in the Sky is an iconic animated film by director Hayao Miyazaki. Set in a fictional late 19th century, it follows the adventures of a boy and girl who are trying to keep a powerful crystal from the army, a group of secret agents, and a family of pirates, while searching for a legendary floating castle, Laputa.
Steve Kasuya has recreated part of the movie in the form of a mysterious black stone with engraved glyphs. When a crystal is passed over it, it lights up strings of glyphs. It uses a Raspberry Pi Pico programmed in MicroPython - Twitter Thread.

## 17:30 Status Updates


17:53 @Liz (hosting)
* I’m starting to work on a robot harp project for Adafruit. It will use a lyre (small harp-esque instrument), 16 servo motors with a PCA9685. It will take in MIDI, similar to the robot xylophone. 
* For personal projects, I had some PCBs made for the modular melody maker project and they are working as expected


19:01 @CGrover (text only)
* A GitHub user found an issue with the NAU7802 24-bit ADC example that at first glance was a simple fix. However, it revealed a deeper data transfer timing problem regarding settling time and data conversion after a channel change that wasn’t documented in the datasheet. A few hours later the driver and simple example were successfully tested, but it was quite the rabbit hole journey. 
* The Eurorack Precision VCO’s PCB design is progressing nicely. Like most (all?) projects, the “nice-to-have” requirements spawned a new project idea, a CircuitPython-driven ADSR envelope generator with selectable preset voices. (ADSR envelopes are to the notes of a musical voice as palettes are to a bitmap image.)


19:52 @danh
* Fixed a problem with Espressif sockets hanging when used with the HTTPServer library. Sockets returned by `accept()` were not always being set to O_NONBLOCK.
* Researched a new reported problem with `usb_cdc.data.read()`. It was an error on the host computer side, which was not asserting DTR. There is another consideration about whether to allow reading the remaining characters after the connection goes down. I tried allowing this but ran into issues. But it’s an edge case.
* Clarified confusing error messages for native properties that are sometimes read-only. [already mentioned in Wednesday CE meeting]
* Reviewed a number of PR’s.
* Remaining issues I’m working on for 8.0.0 include:
   * some S3 crashes in long-running programs, which are mysterious
   * ESP32-S3 I2C, which still needs more testing to resolve whether there is actually an available fix or not


22:54 @David.Glaude (not speaking)
* Searched (and found) a European distributor with a “Pimoroni Pico DV Demo Base” in stock to replicate @jepler Show and Tell demonstration of a DVI co-processor. (now back in stock)
* Worked on my #CircuitPython2023 and published on the learn system: https://learn.adafruit.com/u/dglaude/circuitpython2023-the-year-of-the-circuitpython-retro-gaming-personal-computer (it is an update of my #CircuitPython2021 using @PT idea of RP2040 keyboard/mouse/… and @jepler RP2040 DVI co-processor)
* Recovered my C64 keyboard (and a PS2 keyboard)… I plan to revisit @jepler learn guide that is for another very similar Commodore keyboard.
* Personal: On Monday I lost a “birch tree” in my garden, and that makes me a bit sad (see picture in the chat).


23:49 @DJDevon3
* Continued working on the enclosure design for the TR-Cowbell. Started printing the 2nd prototype enclosure. At 20 hours per section that comes out to 80 hours of printing. Decided to go with a thin intermediary mounting plate for the top. This allows for exploring modular bracket designs without having to reprint the entire top section every iteration.
*   * There’s been no progress with the TR-Cowbell software beyond what FoamyGuy has done. Link to FoamyGuy’s Github code for the TR-Cowbell here. I plan on rolling his code into the TR-Cowbell repo someday just haven’t gotten around to it. @FoamyGuy if you want to push a PR I’d gladly accept it. I’ve spent every day for the past 2 weeks working on the enclosure. Looking forward to the day when I can dive into actually making some music with it.


25:40 @foamyguy(absent today)
Last week
   * Library PR reviews, mostly wiznet5k. Struggled a bit, but made progress in the end
   * Looking into example code docs issue and trying out different versions of sphinx-rtd-theme to resolve it. Checking in on the docs pages after RTD updated our projects to behave the same regardless of creation date
   * Wrote cp 2023. Published to github today
This week
   * A few more ethernet PRs to work through
   * Solder the adapter and try using eye spi display connection for the first time
   * Print a few more stemma LEGO adapter pieces and work on getting it embedded into my table football game in a way that doesn’t make the ball get stuck. Try out multiple distance sensors at once using the I2C hub that arrived with my latest order.
   * Look into busio in the core to see if there is some way it can return the already initialized SPI bus on default pins if user code attempts to initialize it after the core already did it i.e. for a device with a built-in display.


26:50 @kattni
   * Last week and yesterday:
   * Got caught up from being out for the holidays
   * Started my CP2023 post
   * Updated the SHT40/SHT45 guide to include the new SHT45
   * Worked with the support folks at Read the Docs to get the theme version updated on all of our projects (everything before October 2020 was running a very early version of the theme).
   * Was off yesterday.
   * This week:
   * Shorter week, obviously.
   * Already caught up on messages from the long weekend.
   * Possibly finish CP2023 post.
   * Will be starting a template for the EYESPI revisions of displays, that can be used in every guide, and explains the EYESPI connector and wiring, etc.
   * Will also be creating a couple of text blocks for copypasta into other pages in the EYESPI-rev display guides, such as Pinouts and Overview.
   * Add all of this to one guide, so Liz and I have a canonical guide to work from to update the others.


28:55 @tannewt
   * Out monday for holiday. Hoping to have more dedicated time this week.
   * Did most of my CircuitPython2023 post on Friday including testing/screen recording of PyLeap, File Glider and code.circuitpython.org. I want to set aside time each week to do that. Will finish CP23 post today.
   * Sent out fixes for:
   * start and end kwargs on read and write functions now work correctly with multi-byte element arrays
   * Sharing the web workflow MDNS object with the user.
   * More 8.0.0 fixing!


31:28 @tekktrik (not present)
   * Last couple weeks
   * Lots of PR reviews
   * Looking into ways of speeding up Adabot, which would speed up both the generation of the weekly reports as well the checks done when updating Adabot.
   * Submitted a PR to improve how Adabot checks for new and updated libraries in the Adafruit Bundle
   * A few type annotations fixes
   * This week
   * Writing up my CircuitPython 2023 post this evening, still trying to figure out what medium I’ll use, but it will likely be either Mastodon or a GitHub Gist
   * Prototyping a CI update to the test repository to get ahead of some GitHub Actions deprecation warnings, and then propagating it to the bundle libraries if successful.
   * Begin working on fixing some older bugs I submitted
   * Start working on allowing the thermal printer to print images.  A pull request was previously submitted but was not suitable for CircuitPython as it used libraries such as numpy.
   * In personal news, starting a new class about sensors - should be fun!
