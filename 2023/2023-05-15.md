### There are now over 400 CircuitPython compatible microcontroller boards


There are now over 400 CircuitPython compatible microcontroller boards with a large addition this past week. They include boards from many manufacturers - these are boards from the community, companies that are not Adafruit, and entire new businesses / makers using and shipping boards with CircuitPython. Supported chips include: Espressif, Microchip SAMD, Nordic, NXP, RP2040, ST, iMX RT and more! - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2023/05/12/there-are-now-over-400-circuitpython-compatible-microcontroller-boards-circuitpython-python-adafruit/) and [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

It's interesting that it's been less than a year since 300 which is about two boards per week which is fabulous growth.

### 5:20 FreakWAN: a LoRa-based open WAN network


FreakWAN is an effort to create a LoRa-based open WAN network, completely independent from Internet and the cellular phones networks. It is coded in MicroPython with a SX1276 LoRa chip driver. It is possible to send encrypted messages that will reach only other users with a matching symmetric key. FreakWAN also implements its own very small, losslessly compressed 1 bit images, as a proof of concept that can send small media types over LoRa - [GitHub](https://github.com/antirez/freakwan) via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/wvdsteen/status/1656288304885530625) and [Y Combinator](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35882967).
### 6:19 Using MicroPython to get started with AWS IoT Core


You can use MicroPython to get started with AWS IoT Core with a recent guide by Amazon. Prototype your project to quickly test a full IoT solution. MicroPython makes it easy to connect a device to AWS IoT Core and route messages to other AWS services - [Amazon](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/iot/using-micropython-to-get-started-with-aws-iot-core/).

## 16:23 Hug reports


16:49 @danh (hosting)
* @jepler for continuing with synthio.
* @thess for continued PR’s to fix network-related issues.
* @tannewt for suggesting we are just about ready for an 8.1.0 release candidate


17:40 @CGrover (text only)
* @jepler and the team of testers for synthio. I was blown away when the foundational building blocks emerged and was utterly amazed when I heard polyphony, envelopes, and effects.


17:57 @DJDevon3
* @Tyeth for helping with an algorithm. Tyeth entered a BME280 bias adjust script I wrote into ChatGPT which spit out a 99% correct answer. Only thing it got wrong was trying to import numpy instead of ulab.numpy. I no longer see ChatGPT as an evil overlord but as a relatively helpful tool.
* @FoamyGuy & @Neradoc for an interesting conversation about REST API’s.
* @LadyAda & @PT for dealing with Facebook incorrectly tagging Show & Tell as hate speech
* @GroupHug for everyone who doesn’t engage in hate speech… which is everyone


19:54 @foamyguy
* @bill88t and @anecdata for testing out some debug builds to help isolate an issue I was seeing
* @NetNinja on Youtube for some great basic Vue.js tutorial videos
* @makermelissa for a pointer to confirm the behavior of dots when shown on 14x4 segments for a change that I’ve submitted


20:59 @jepler
* Dan for doing so much to bring 8.1.0 to stable, and for offering to do one of the upcoming micropython merges
* Todbot for making some demos showcasing synthio
* Jp, todbot, gamblor for feedback on the next direction for synthio


21:47 @kattni
* @tekktrik for updating Pylint and Black across all the libraries, and fixing up the ones that had issues.
* @foamyguy for looking into an issue with our projects on Read the Docs
* @jepler for tons of help with my current project code
* @danh for going through it to ensure I didn’t leave any test prints in there, and questioning my logic as well
* @foamyguy for talking through a specific CP feature and whether it would work on a silly project idea
* @neradoc for more help with my code
* @bill88t for a bunch of help with a WiFi issue in my code
* @tannewt for adding Inky Frame to CP core
* Group hug


22:46 @makermelissa
* Group Hug


22:57 @Mark[gamblor21] (missing)
* @todbot for answering some synth questions about a couple YT videos he made
* @jepler for all the synthio work. The depth of what it can do is mind blowing (so is the math behind it)


23:18 @carter  (text only)
* @tekktrik / @kattni for heads up on CI deprecation needing attention in Arduino library repos
* @eva for updating all repos for above


23:48 @tannewt
* @joshua from TinyVIsion AI who was cheering me on for CircuitPython board def for pico-ice. RP2040 + ICE40UP5k


24:31 @tekktrik (out)
* @danh, @Jose Dave, @kattni, and @foamyguy for PR reviews last week for helping with recent patches
* Group hug!
## 25:00 Status Updates


25:33 @danh (hosting)
* Finishing off final issues for 8.1.0
* Fixes and other work for 8.1.0:
   * Allow native adafruit_bus_device to have no chip select pin.
   * On STM, don’t change monotonic time when RTC date/time is changed.
   * Report actual SPI frequency on Espressif.
   * Closed some issues and pushed a few others to 8.x.x.
   * Lotsa reviews.
* Also did a bunch of reviews for library housekeeping PR’s.


26:31 @CGrover (text only)
* Been running a three-ring PCB design and build circus lately and haven’t been coding much. Nine more boards to assemble followed by two new designs to send to OSH Park. After that, we’ll put all the boards back into the clown car, take down the tent, and move on to wrapping up some CircuitPython coding projects and associated guides.


26:53 @DJDevon3
* I wrote a basic algorithm for temperature bias adjusting the BME280 sensor module but it was all Tyeth & ChatGPT who slimmed it down to a linear algorithm using ulab.numpy. I’ve calibrated the bias against multiple mercury thermometers. The bias adjustment now makes the BME280 super precise to within a tenth of a degree no matter the pcb temperature. It’s almost as accurate as a mercury thermometer. The algorithm only needs to go down to 50F, below that the PCB is sufficiently cooled and does not affect the reading. The algorithm is a work in progress. The more data points in the curve I can feed it the more accurate it will become. By default the BME280 is about 96% accurate which means there’s an 8 degree deviation when over 110F. My algorithm brings the accuracy up to 99.1% and I’m shooting for 99.9% this summer. Since I’m in Florida I’m in a good position to track the data points needed above 110F.
* Went on Show & Tell with a Feather DVI weather station which I plan on using to live stream during hurricanes (until I lose power). Tested my first livestream showing organizing the GUI elements.
* Have a new project on the horizon using an ItsyBitsy NRF52840 with CGrover’s ItsyBitsy adapter & Adafruit connect mobile app to control an LED candle color. Thought about using WLED at first but after seeing all the hoops you have to jump through with WLED decided to go with a Circuit Python solution.


29:20 @foamyguy
* Validate a change to fix some of the interactive elements in the RTD docs pages for libraries, tested it on one library and sent over to Tektrik for patching
* Created an HTTP API for initializing and controlling RGB LED lights using JSON data passed via requests. Currently supports neopixels and dotstars for setting individual colors and filling the full strips. Planning to add support for led animations.
* Submitted non-blocking marquee for HT16K33 library. Will carry out some additional testing on strings with dots in them.
* Started up a Feather S2 TFT running with a debug build to try to capture logs for a hard fault potentially related to running an HTTPServer on the device after it’s been running for a while.
* Trying to learn the basics of Vue.js in order to be able to tinker locally with EduBlocks project.


31:54 @jepler
* Synthio tremolo, vibrato, frequency sweep & ring mod merged
* Consensus was that connectable LFOs was a sensible next step, started implementation this morning. It’s nearly ready to try hooking in to replace the original tremolo & vibrato, then jp & todbot (& liz & gamblor?) can kick the tires. PR tomorrow maybe?
* Also made lots of progress on my xerox 820 CP/M machine. Working on a simple passive adapter board for a PC’s 34-pin floppy connector to the 39-pin connector on the Xerox’s drive box. – I blogged about the machine: https://emergent.unpythonic.net/01683808046


33:37 @kattni
* Last week:
   * Finally figured out that the issue with my Canary nightlight code is that there’s some problem with it and ESP32-S2, but that it works flawlessly on ESP32-S3. So……. The project now uses the S3 QT Py. 
   * Related: I should still try my code on a different ESP32-S2 to make sure I don’t have a bad board. That said, if it is still present, someone should probably look into why it fails so spectacularly. That person will not be me, though I’m happy to test.
   * Finally wrapped up the canary nightlight code
   * Started the ADXL/ADT FeatherWing guide
   * Started the Canary Nightlight guide
   * Updated guides:
      * M7 guide re: PWM audio capable pins
      * PID2601 guide updated with new rev where needed
      * PID4147 QTification revealed no guide, so that’s been shifted from update to new guide
* This week in no particular order:
   * Do as much of the ADXL/ADT guide as possible without the hardware (Order placed on Friday; shipped today. Will get that as soon as it arrives.)
   * Once hardware is obtained, finish the above guide.
   * Finish up my part of the Canary Nightlight guide so I’m not blocking Noe when he’s ready to finish it.
   * New choc neokey breakout guide
   * Misc:
      * Guide update: PID4775 revision with boot button on side, and MAX17 battery monitor
      * Guide update: PID390 USBCification
      * Go through list of fixes on USB Host Feather RP2040 guide, and apply them to my recent Feather RP2040 guide.
      * Three more in todo list!
   * As time permits:
      * Background projects.
* Otherwise:
   * My new laptop started its first day of work this morning. I did a fresh install, so we’ll see how this goes. Previous-laptop is still ready to rescue things if needed. Excited though!


38:03 @makermelissa
* Last Week:
   * Finished Adding a bunch of Blinka boards to circuitpython.org putting us at 120 boards
   * Finished updating the code for my collaboration project with Erin
   * Updated PlatformDetect so that it now decodes the Raspberry Pi Rev code and intelligently determines the appropriate board. This will make it much less work to manage every time Raspberry Pi updates a board.
   * Fixed some issues with the Raspberry Pi Installer Scripts
   * Fixed the links for the RP2040 Feather ThinkInk on circuitpython.org
* This Week:
   * Work on Collab project guide
   * More Github issues and GitHub Actions improvements


36:02 @tannewt
* Wrapping up two helper libraries I did: JSON_Stream (for epd weather display) and Prompt_Toolkit (for circuitpyrate).
* Will look at CircuitPyrate support for ICE40 loading and SWD support.
* Circling back to USB host for a bit of testing once Thach has merged some improvements.
* Will circle back to continue iMX testing / porting learn guide.
* Made PR for Inky Frame 5.7 and a prototype branch for pico-ice.


39:10 @tekktrik (out)
* Last week
   * Updated pylint and other pinned versions of pre-commit tools across the libraries
   * Fixed an issue with the cookiecutter where Community Bundles would be missing a newline
   * Submitted a PR to the core to build the stubs package in an updated, more recent method
   * Submitting a patch for review that will finish updating pylint for a deprecation warning as well as a fix for an issue with jQuery that foamyguy implemented.
* This week
   * Continuing to go through a backlog of issues to complete
   * Looking into making some changes to the Learn Guide repo to speed up the CI checks
