MicroPython v1.20.0 Released
 MicroPython v1.20.0 Released 

MicroPython v1.20.0 has been released and it contains a wide array of improvements and fixes. Of particular note, it has a new lightweight package manager called mip, which uses a custom protocol to query and install packages that is optimised for embedded systems. It is intended to take over the role of upip and supports installing packages from micropython-lib as well as any URL. The Raspberry Pi Pico W is now supported with WiFi. See all the changes - GitHub. Download and GitHub Discvussions.
"...there is a lot more coming in the pipeline. MicroPython is part of Google's Season of Docs for the third time so there will be even more improvements to the documentation in the coming 6 months. There is work on some new hardware targets, and we intend to put more effort into the zephyr port. We would also like to make progress this year towards MicroPython v2.

## 26:38 Status Updates
@jepler (host)
* Last weeks:
   * Vacationed in Utah. Utah’s National parks are so lovely!
   * Attended PyCon
      * So many good things going on in the keynotes, talks, sprints, open spaces, hallway track. A small write-up of my experience will be in the newsletter.
      * I showed at least a half dozen people how to do gel nails one afternoon, and let folks use my supplies and tools. One other person also brought her own curing station down. That was great, unexpected fun.  Shall we do pycon polish as an open space in 2024?? Not sure I can bring my kit on the plane though.
   * Worked on adding ADSR envelope to synthio
* This week:
   * Received the order to ‘keep synthin plz’ so I will:
      * Finalize ADSR
      * Continue with arbitrary frequency (instead of just MIDI notes); stretching to tremolo, vibrato, and per-note ADSR & waveform.  Stretch-stretching to include frequency sweep, though it might be good enough to do it in Python code
   * Test my 128x32 matrixportal setup with current CircuitPython to try to confirm a customer problem
   * Check guide feedback and update any guides accordingly
   * Check right channel output on metro m7
* Other:
   * At an estate sale on Saturday I bought a Xerox 820 computer system including an enclosure with 2 massive 8” floppies, and 4 boxes of floppy disks. This CPM computer was widely panned at the time of its introduction as being no better than other Z-80 machines, not nearly as mind-blowing as products like the Xerox Alto was, but carrying the price premium of the Xerox name. Amazingly, it will boot from floppy to a CPM “A>” prompt! I hope I can find something useful to do with it. (the original owner seems to have been a HAM and also seems to have worked for a local company of some note; the computer might have been formerly used for company work based on the labels on some of the floppies. wish I knew more of the story but it’s probably lost forever) https://octodon.social/@stylus/110283477725083795


30:52 @danh
* Released CircuitPython 8.1.0-beta.2 last Wednesday.
* Made demo for Feather RP2040 Prop-Maker.
* Started looking at @gneverov’s asyncio rework again.


31:37 @DJDevon3 
* Helped AndyWarburton beta test the Unexpected Maker FeatherS2.  Ran about 25,000 transactions to AdafruitIO over 4 days without a single hard fault which should help close multiple bug reports lingering from 7.3.3. The UM FeatherS2 Wifi is now confirmed as stable.
* Beta tested the Unexpected Maker FeatherS3 with the same test which might close a few more  issues all the way up to the current stable release. This should wipe the slate clean for most if not all of the hard faults on the UM Feather S2 & S3 prior to 8.0.5 stable release. 🙂 For Scott who likes to keep issues down to 1 page, devs can now look into closing anything UM FeatherS2 or S3 Wifi related.
* Purchased a RadioLink AT9S RC transmitter with a range of about ½ mile. The controller that comes with the little RC tank only has a range of about 20 feet. Will be attempting to swap out the electronics in the sewer bot to accept a receiver with much great signal strength & range. Got both pan & tilt working on a 3D printed FPV camera mount which replaces the toy tank turret. Also got a couple small hobby motors working with the transmitter. I can honestly build my own RC car from scratch now which got me thinking… it should be possible with LORA to make a long range RC car 100% in circuit python. That one is now on my to do list.


33:34 @foamyguy
* Reviewing and testing for the influx of PRs. Most new contributors worked on typing information, though a few other fixes and improvements were sprinkled in a few libraries too.
* Testing the latest version of (now merged) PR with improvements to the Wiznet Ethernet library
* Tried out the proposed new version of HTTPServer
* Got my ‘back in stock’ notice for Feather DVI and got one ordered so I can get in on the HDMI fun soon
* Outside CP: Working on a web based application for my wife that assists her in authoring an HTML file that the writes content for regularly. Instead of digging in and coding the HTML by hand, this tool provides a form to fill in the desired content for everything needed and a generate button to render the final HTML code from the data entered. It uses Flask framework, Jinja2 templating, and Bulma front end 
* Try to expand HT16K33 library to provide non-blocking text marquee functionality. I have a plan in mind to use a Feather tripler or quad filled with different wings and all inter-operating. 14x4 segments is one of the wings I’d like to use


36:18 @Jose David (Text only)
* Reviews some  PRs
* Added the slider library to the community library. 
* Worked in the LPS28FDW pressure sensor Circuitpython support


36:36 @kattni
* I have returned from PyCon 2023. It was entirely brilliant. 
* I left home with approximately 70 CPXs and 30 CPBs, and came back with 2 CPXs and 15 CPBs, which is to say, the Open Spaces were excellent, and everyone was super into it.
   * Oddly Saturday was very quiet, but evidently the whole conference felt that way. Friday was packed and Sunday was even more packed. 
* We hosted the most successful Sprints since we began hosting them, based purely on PR numbers. 
* I sent both Open Spaces and Sprints folks home with hardware. 
* Definitely a few things that could be improved upon for next year. (Nothing serious; small things that would make the experience smoother for the folks involved.)
* I’m jumping into joining the organisation team for PyOhio this year in a big way, with specific role details still to come. Super excited about this!
* For this week:
   * The next thing on my list is finishing the RFM95 RP2040 guide
   * M7 pwmio page update for specific pins
   * Code for canary night/day light with Feature Requests included
   * Four guide updates as well.
   * Sometime soon: discuss details with tekktrik on updating the CI on the GitHub repo that contains all the code embedded into Adafruit Learn Guides to shorten up the time and resources currently used for every PR.


41:23 @MakerMelissa (text only)
* Last 2 weeks:
   * Got the code for a collaboration project with Erin in a good place3
   * Successfully finished a big move from Oregon to Las Vegas. I worked on packing, loading, and driving with between 12 and 18-hour days for a solid week and a half or so.

41:55 @tammymakesthings
* Last week:
   * Completed the first round of design for a project I’m building for my nephew, an audio amplifier and oscillator board which, combined with a tiny oscilloscope from Amazon, will enable him to make “a map of sounds”.
* This week:
   * Prototyping and testing the different sub-modules of my “map of sounds” project before I do the board design. (If there’s anybody who’s good with analog circuits and wouldn’t mind looking over my schematic for obvious mistakes, please PM me - I’d appreciate another set of eyes.)
   * Hopefully working on the design for an RP2040 build I’m designing to be a base for music/MIDI projects.
* Other:
   * Still struggling with health stuff, but hopefully getting closer to a successful resolution.


42:56 @tannewt
*  PRs close for:
   * Supporting iMX RT 1015, 1040 and 1050 in CP and also TinyUF2.
   * EPD fixes for little endian addressing are waiting on reviews.
   * Waiting on review from jepler on frequency setting on RP2040.
   * Switching picodvi.Framebuffer to taking the framebuffer size. (Not signal output size.)
* Will circle back to porting learn guide. I want to make a list of what to complete before publishing so I have an end in sight.


45:21 @tekktrik (not present)
* Last week
   * Reviewing PRs from PyCon, so excited to see all the issues closed this week - with more in the works!
   * After nearly four years of collaborative effort, I am excited to announce that my most extensive pull request was recently accepted!  Maintainers are now discussing when changes will be merged but are thrilled with new feature additions.
  



* This week
   * Catching up on things post-PyCon, some new ideas for fixes and patches emerged during and since so I’ll be looking into those
