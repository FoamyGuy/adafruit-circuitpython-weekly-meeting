## 13:22 Hug reports
@jepler (host)
* group hug!


@danh
* @romkey and @eightycc for characterizing the macOS Sonoma delayed write problem.
* @eightycc for all kinds of filesystem work. Researching how to force FAT16, how to put 6 pounds of potatoes in a 4-pound sack on tiny 64kB CIRCUITPY drives, making CIRCUITPY mountable on Android. Latter two in CIrcuitPython 9.0.0-alpha.4.
* @lookfwd for adding I2S MCLK support on Espressif.
* @retiredwizard for 9.0.0-alpha testing.
* @jessejonesand @supcik: new contributors to French translation.
* @jepler for approving a PR build fix over the weekend so I could get 9.0.0-alpha.4 out.
* @bill88t for fixing ESP32-C6 wifi.
* @imnotjames for working on asyncio


15:58 @DJDevon3 (text only)

* @RuizBrothers for a beautiful little Christmas tree made of noods and 3D printing.
* @DanH and Team for releasing Circuit Python 9.0 Alpha 4 this week.
* @Tannewt for all the work on dynamic memory and split heap voodoo
* @RetiredWizard & @JacobMarble helping to track down heap & pystack bugs.
* Group Hug


16:35 @eightycc (text only)
* @DanH for working tirelessly with me on Discord, providing useful feedback and suggestions.
* @Anecdata for cooking up the test for my Wifi.stop_ap() pull.


16:48 @foamyguy
* @vladak for adding support to circup for web workflow 
* @danh for keeping new releases going
* @tannewt for a very helpful tip about pip install -e and for sharing thoughts on circup changes I was working on during deep dive
* Group hug


17:30 @kattni
* @paul cutler for a lovely chat and more ideas
* @melissa for a great chat
* @eightycc for pointing me to a specific workaround for CP on MacOS Sonoma, and for jumping in to let me know that running a MacOS VM in Parallels won’t help
* @romkey for letting me know that an Ubuntu VM works in Sonoma with some caveats
* @krayola for spending the last few days elbow deep in JavaScript and Python working to make image handling in Pelican better and easier to do
* Group hug!


18:10 @Liz
* @tannewt for working with me on the ADS7830 library
* @Jepler welcome back from vacation
* @DJDevon for documenting his large matrix panel project. The tiling diagram was very helpful for someone I was assisting on the team

18:41 @makermelissa
* @jepler welcome back
* @kattni for a great chat
* Group Hug


18:57 @Paul Cutler
* @eightycc and @danh for their work troubleshooting the macOS Sonoma filesystem issue
* Group hug


19:10 @RetiredWizard (Text only)
* @rgrizzel for the Lilygo T-Deck PR. After I blew up my, now unattainable, Keyboard Featherwing I had plans to get the Lilygo T-Deck working with CircuitPython but thanks to rgrizzel’s work, I was able to just pick it up and start Python coding for it.
* A group hug for all the Adafruit developers and community contributors.


19:34 @tannewt
* @foamyguy for deep diving while my schedule is uncertain.
## 19:53 Status Updates
@jepler (host)
* Digging in to some camera issues that have been raised
* Then other 9.0.0 bugs
* Missed y’all! Have another group hug.


20:59 @danh
* Released CircuitPython 9.0.0-alpha.4 on Sunday. Alpha.3 build release had problems, so I fixed those and moved on to the next number. This release has the new “split heap” storage scheme and needs tuning to resolve storage issues with larger programs.
* More displayio refactoring changes.
* Fixing 8.2.x and 9.0.0 bugs, of which there are many.


@DJDevon3 (text only)
* Submitted my ESP32-S3 Feather Weather with MQTT project to Playground. Documentation isn’t as fun as building the projects.
* For a personal house project I designed & 3D printed 9 feet of white U-channel for a side-lit LED strip. The house builder in their infinite wisdom decided to only install a hallway light switch at the end of the hallway. It uses a PIR motion sensor to automatically activate the LED strip installed along the top edge of the baseboard.
*   

@eightycc (text only)
   * Resolved CP USB MSC not mounting on Android.
   * Recovered about 25% of flash filesystem space for boards with tiny flash, for example M0 Trinket.
   * As part of my RP2 _bleio work, updated the CYW43 driver to see if it resolved any open RP2 Wifi issues. It didn’t, but the work pointed me to a resolution for Wifi.stop_ap().
   * Continue working on RP2 _bleio, it’s got my full attention this week.


23:21 @foamyguy
   * Completed the pass through Learn Guide code repo updating code for the new displayio API and went back this morning to update the guide pages that had code or mentions of display.show() that weren’t in embedded code.
   * Working on the proposed web workflow support for circup to allow it to work with the -auto flag 
   * More thorough testing of normal USB and new web workflow functionality in circup


24:59 @kattni
   * Been blocked on releasing content due to image handling on my blog. Turns out the image situation in Pelican isn’t that great. My wife is working on writing a new plugin that makes it a lot more straightforward. I was able to understand the Python side of it, but I know nothing about javascript, so a huge piece of that puzzle is outside my wheelhouse.  
   * I have a series of posts written up that are waiting on images. I’m hoping to start getting those out this week.
   * My office looks like someone set off a glitter-bomb full of parts. I decided to finally organise everything, and fortunately or unfortunately for me, that means gathering everything and sorting it. It also means deciding how I want to organise it. I already have the microcontrollers handled. How I handle the rest will depend on how much of each thing I have. I ordered a bunch of compartment bins ahead of this project, so I am not lacking in places to put things. I am looking forward to stacks of labeled bins on my shelf, and being able to see the floor again.


26:12 @Liz
   * I wrapped up the ADS7830 ADC library and added it to the bundle. The guide is in moderation so you should see it pop up on the new guides page soon. I also updated the Metro ESP32-S3 guide to reflect the Rev B hardware changes
   * Over the weekend I soldered up the breakout boards for my patchbay project. Happy to report they are working as expected. Currently waiting on the acrylic mounting panel to come in from sendcutsend and then I’ll be able to start fully assembling it.


27:09 @makermelissa:
   * Last 2 Weeks:
   * Wrote the PCA9554 Driver
   * Wrote the CST8XX driver for arduino, which is my first new arduino library
   * Updated the qualia guide with 2.1” round display touch screen usage
   * Added the 4” Round display to the guide
   * Finished writing the Adafruit Qualia Library which allows easy changing of displays and touch drivers just by changing the Display ID as well as access all of the peripherals
   * Helped Erin with writing code for a MatrixPortal project
   * Started looking into revamping the Pi Eyes bonnet stuff so it will run better on modern Raspberry Pi hardware
   * This Week:
   * Short week for me because I’m taking some time off starting on the 16th
   * Finishing up helping Erin
   * Continuing to update Pi Eyes stuff
   * Update any new boards on circuitpython.org
   * Write a script to list any hidden boards for circuitpython.org so I can easily see if new info has popped up for those boards since adding them
   * Personal Projects:
   * Working on creating my first CircuitPython board to work with Lego Mindstorms sensors and motors. Still in the prototyping phase and learning KiCad better.
   * Repairing and upgrading an old Dell Inspiron 1545 laptop to run better.
                
29:13 @Paul Cutler
   * After too long of a break, I’m recording two episodes of The CircuitPython Show this week and hope to have the first episode out next Monday.


29:33 @RetiredWizard (Text Only)
   * Spent a lot of time coding a command line history/editor for the Lilygo T-Deck PyDOS keyboard handler, as well as special character sequences for generating characters missing from the keyboard, like square brackets and the "equals" sign. Next, I plan to add the same features to my touch screen and "BB 20Q" I2C keyboard handlers
   * Need to put aside the “fun” coding projects and get back to compiling the silly FULL_BUILD=0 PR for various port/board configurations so it can be taken out of draft and considered for merging.


30:10 @tannewt
   * Still off and on because my mom is in the hospital.
   * Got Metro S3 Rev B to test SD cards with.
   * Will likely look into pystack exhausted reports. I thought it stayed the same size with the split heap stuff but I must have missed something. Fixed in: https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/8598
   * Tim is deep diving the next two weeks.
## In The Weeds
   * What weeks to skip during the upcoming holiday season (@jepler)
   * Normal for US Thanksgiving.
   * Skip 12/25 for Christmas.
   * Push 1/1/2024 meeting to Tuesday 1/2/2024


## Wrap-Up
