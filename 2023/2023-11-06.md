## 15:28 Hug reports


15:52 @foamyguy (hosting)
* @PaulCutler and @RetiredWizard both for submitting fixes for new displayio APIs across many libraries.
* @danh for doing many library reviews and digging into docs and issues related to new displayio API changes


16:16 @danh (can’t connect to discord)
* @RetiredWizard and @PRCutler for doing PR’s to update all the libraries not to use displayio .show(). 
* @eightycc for doing a lot of ongoing FATfs investigation and doing fixes. 


16:42 @david.glaude (not present):
* @DanH for helping with the 9.x transition
* Paul and Foamyguy for fixing many of the change needed displayio API change in 9.x
* MakerMelissa for work on the S3 Matrix Portal and the message board


17:13 @CGrover (text only)
* @jepler for the superb gift of synthio that just keeps giving.
* @foamyguy for creating an excellent solution for circup module dependencies
* Group hug to the team and community.


17:36 @DJDevon3 (text only)
* @CircuitPythonDevelopers for all the new changes in 9.0 you’ve all put a lot of work into it. I’m excited to see where Circuit Python is headed.
* @FoamyGuy for a neat deep dive on how to switch display projects to use 9.0 .root_group syntax and finding some really neat legacy edge cases where .show() is using its own display method.
* @PostHalloweenGroupHug 🎃


18:14 @kattni
* @paul cutler and @makermelissa for great suggestions and information on my latest endeavors 
* @foamyguy for help with a piece of code from some time in 2022
* Congrats on the 9.0 upgrades, I saw a lot of resolved closed issues go by.
* Group hug to all of the folks joining me in my new adventure
* Group hug to this community for continuing to be amazing


19:26 @Liz
* @elpekenin for suggesting the udecimal library for the mars clock project
* Jeff for writing the udecimal library and for giving me some feedback on how to better use the API
* Group hug
 
19:50 @tannewt
* @danh, @foamyguy, @prcutler and RetiredWizard for updating libraries to .root_group.
* Adafruit coworkers for support and flexibility.
## 20:09 Status Updates
20:34 @foamyguy (hosting)
* Circup Dependencies for libraries that are in a bundle, but not deployed to pypi. Successful proof of concepts submitted
   * Modified build-tools to add pyproject.toml file into the bundles
   * Modified circup to look for a circup dependencies list inside of pyproject.toml and install them
* Updating learn guide code for displayio API changes in 9.x+
* Testing new HTTPServer examples
* Deep Dive on Friday


22:06 @CGrover (text only)
* Had a need to use synthio-generated ADSR envelopes and LFO waveforms for a Eurorack project. Although CV-like input is supported by the synthio.voct_to_hz function, CV output is achieved by tricking synthio.Note to modulate Note.amplitude with the envelope or LFO. Although the result is workable, it rectifies the CV input since amplitude can only be a positive value – okay for an ADSR envelope but problematic for an LFO sine wave. A discussion and recommendations are detailed in an repo issue and this Playground note: https://adafruit-playground.com/u/CGrover/pages/eurorack-control-voltage-cv-signals-from-synthio
* The twice-annual test of my automatic DST adjuster helper for real-time clocks was again successful. It was deployed over three years ago to four local and three remote clocks but I continue to treat the change event as a code test. Looking forward to the US Congress finally eliminating the need for the helper and all the testing. https://github.com/CedarGroveStudios/CircuitPython_DST_Adjuster


23:39 @danh (can’t connect to discord)
* Re-tested LC709203F on ESP32-S3 on 9.0.0-alpha.2, which is updated to ESP-IDF v5.1. Seems to work a lot better. BNO055 still does not work, but it doesn’t work on a lot of microcontrollers.
* Opened issues for all libraries that used the deprecated .show() from displayio. PRCutler and RetiredWizard addressed all these issues. I merged and created new releases.
* Starting to look at 9.0.0 bugs.
* Made issues for updating libraries not to use .show(). These were done much more quickly than I expected by RetiredWizard and PRCutler. They did the PR’s, and I reviewed and did the releases.
* Did more debugging on NINA-FW, comparing arduino and adafruit versions, and now understand which versions do and don’t work.


24:51 @david.glaude (not present):
* Teddy Ruxpin:
   * Changing eyes color from Blue to Red (adapting ruxalyser code). => https://github.com/dglaude/ruxalyzer-for-teddy-ruxpin
   * Controlling the activation of Teddy Ruxpin with Time of Flight sensor and “Feather RP2040 with USB Type A Host” and bonus LED screen to display distance and status. => https://gist.github.com/dglaude/26f3b2d389197fb34a2881faf56f31f6
   * Went to Show and Tell to share the result.
* CP
   * Testing upgrade to 9.0.0-alpha-2 (Trinkey RP2040 + temperature sensor + I2C LCD)  and a fight with circup, mpy compatibility, displayio changes, …
   * Testing QR code reading with Tiny Sensor and output usb-hid keyboard with French layout. (works fine in 8.x and mysterious crash with 9.x)
   * Migrating my Matrix Display from Pimoroni board to the new S3 Matrix Portal, but I need to adapt the learn guide to my matrix resolution and size ( https://learn.adafruit.com/matrixportal-circuitpython-animated-message-board )
* Non CP:
   * Helping my son’s girlfriend with Arduino thanks to a Metro 328 and some guide from Adafruit… not sure how I am going to help her with Visual Basic (sic) and Access… on her MAC.


26:39 @DJDevon3 (text only)
* Due to daylight savings time yesterday, I got tired of switching timezone offset in settings.toml manually twice a year. OpenWeatherMap now has a feature they call geocoding that will automatically extract your timezone and offset based on your latitude & longitude. This feature was not present when I started coding my Feather Weather script. Updated it with the geocoding JSON call and works great. If anyone out there is using OpenWeatherMap look into automating your local time now with lat/lon and never have to worry about timezone offset again.  
* For Halloween got a cyberpunk looking helmet that incorporates a 16x32 flexible 4mm pitch LED matrix that smoothly wraps around the inside of the helmet visor. It requires a shady Chinese mobile app that I’m not a fan of. This week I’ll be working on piping it to an ItsyBitsy Bluefruit to get it running on Circuit Python. If successful, I will detail it in Playground Notes.
* Helped a few people in Discord get their projects working. Hearing people get excited when they get an LED to turn on never gets old. 🎉


28:08 @eightycc (text only)
* Debugging mostly. OpenOCD and PicoProbe ate up most of my time. No complaints, a journey well worth taking.


28:21 @kattni
* After two months of nonstop work, I’m incredibly excited to share that I reached an important milestone in my latest adventure. It took much longer than I expected, though, in hindsight (as always), it seems like maybe I should have expected it. I’m still not entirely ready, but I understand that I never will be. This needed to happen, so I went with it. You can check out the details [here](https://kattni.com/exciting-news)
* Spent parts of the last three days writing up the first project I’ll be covering. The text is basically done, and I’m working on figuring out the best way to handle images. I use a Python-based static site generator which can do images natively, but I suspect it won’t scale well. So, I’m trying to mitigate that from the start instead of needing to go back through everything. It was suggested to host the images on Pixelfed and embed them from there. If anyone has any other suggestions, I’m interested to learn about other options, regardless of whether I use them.

* In continuing to work on the mars clock project, I hit the float limits of CircuitPython. Luckily, Discord user elpekenin pointed me in the direction of jepler’s CircuitPython decimal library. Using that library allowed for an accurate Mars Sol date calculation and as a result, accurate Mars time comparable to the official Mars24 NASA clock. I wrote up a [Playground post](https://adafruit-playground.com/u/BlitzCityDIY/pages/accurately-calculating-coordinated-mars-time-with-circuitpython) on the process and will include it as a footnote in the upcoming Learn guide
* I also just retrieved some PCBs from OSHPark from my mailbox a few minutes ago. I’m going to be building a patchbay for the Arturia keystep pro MIDI controller.
