## 2:58 Community News
### 3:13 MicroPython 1.21 Released!
MicroPython 1.21 was released Friday with significant changes since the 1.20 release last April:
**New and Changed**


* Built-in modules to remove the u-prefix
* Switching of the esp32 port to use IDF 5
* Support for BLE on RPi Pico W boards
* Importing has been tweaked and optimised
* Conversion specifiers in f-strings (e.g. !r)
* ESP8266 and ESP32 ports add support for the Espressif ESP-NOW protocol
* An extensive LoRa module has been added
* And much more


All of this without a performance hit since the previous release - [GitHub](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/releases/tag/v1.21.0).


### 4:33 Python 3.12.0 Final Released
Python 3.12 final is now out – [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3120/).


**New features**


* More flexible f-string parsing, allowing many things previously disallowed (PEP 701).
* Support for the buffer protocol in Python code (PEP 688).
* A new debugging/profiling API (PEP 669).
* Support for isolated subinterpreters with separate Global Interpreter Locks (PEP 684).
* Even more improved error messages. More exceptions potentially caused by typos now make suggestions to the user.
* Support for the Linux perf profiler to report Python function names in traces.
* Many large and small performance improvements (like PEP 709 and support for the BOLT binary optimizer), delivering an estimated 5% overall performance improvement.


The PSF also has announced Python 3.11.6 - [PSF](https://blog.python.org/2023/10/python-3116-is-now-available.html) and [download](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3116/).

## 17:15 Hug reports
17:52 @tannewt (host)
* @makermelissa for improving Blinka DisplayIO to support grayscale OLED and epd.
* @micropython team for releasing 1.21!


18:29 @CGrover (text only)
* @todbot for urging me to learn and apply Python list comprehension. The technique was particularly magical when summing the square of differences for a multichannel spectrometer sensor project. Didn’t know what I was missing.
* @JohnPark for his support, patience, and creative insight as I labored over iterations of spectrometer sensor code.
* @deshipu for the BNo055 9-DoF sensor library. There are some advanced (for me) driver coding examples in there that got my attention whilst attempting to understand sensor internals.


19:16 @david.glaude (text only)
* CGrover for a lot of great “Playgound” post on https://adafruit-playground.com/u/CGrover   


19:56 @djdevon3 (text only)
* @FoamyGuy for a very pleasant saturday morning stream
* @Todbot for neat youtube video demos of his picotouchsynth
* @CGrover for continual code examples for audio and displayio related projects
* @BlitzCityDIY for an amazing sports scoreboard project that will likely continue to give year after year for sports fans. Now that we’re in football season I really want to try it out.
* @CircuitPythonDevelopers for all their hard work on the ESP-IDF & MicroPython merges.
* group hug


20:38 @eightycc (text only)
* Group hug


20:47 @foamyguy
* @makermelissa for many improvements in Blinka DisplayIO
* Group hug


21:18 @MakerMelissa
* @jepler for doing a lot of the technical setup for the Qualia Product Guide
* @blitzcitydiy for helping me make my first Fritzing part
* Group Hug
## 22:00 Status Updates
22:06 @tannewt (host)
* A bit of an off and on week because my partner is out of town. So I’m solo parenting (until I got to my parent’s house.)
* Sketched out memory allocation changes. Really happy with them so far but need MP 1.21 to fully realize the MP heap auto-growth. Changes are here: https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/compare/main...tannewt:circuitpython:switch_to_split_heap Lots of stuff is much cleaner.
* Working on MP 1.20 merge w/Dan. Focussed on getting CI going. Will rebase on Dan’s changes from over the weekend.


23:43 @CGrover (text only)
* Finished the code portion of the AS7341 spectrometer sensor-based TV backlight. The project illuminates the wall behind the TV display with a color that matches what the sensor sees near the edge of the screen. Next step is to build a camouflaged enclosure and vertical mounting wands for the NeoPixel strips. https://adafruit-playground.com/u/CGrover/pages/as7341-tv-backlight
* Expecting the perfect purple PCBs to arrive later this week for the PCM510xA I2S stereo DAC project. The pinout of the PCM510xA board will match that of the MAX98357A 3-watt I2S mono amplifier breakout so that it can be used as a direct replacement or stacked in parallel to provide a simultaneous stereo line output. The PCM510xA is a modern in-stock replacement for the Adafruit UDA1334 I2S DAC breakout that was discontinued after the chip was retired.


24:59 @david.glaude (text only)
* Mostly non CP work on Teddy Ruxpin
* CP Trying to enable/disable the USB-A of the Feather USB Host, works in 8.2.6 but fail in 9.x ("ValueError: USB_HOST_5V_POWER in use").
Goal: Turn off eyes and close mouth of Teddy Ruxpin (when USB is enabled/connected) and goes into the Idle sequence when the USB is disabled/disconnected.


25:42 @djdevon3 (text only)
* Helped in discord a little
* Cleaned 3 carburetors for a generator, chainsaw, and car engine. House maintenance and repair  projects.
* Almost got to pet a skunk by accident. Having a good time with family.


26:10 @eightycc (text only)
* Continue adding RP2 _bleio support
* Building MacOS user agent that sets noasync flag on removable device mounts to work around Sonoma data corruption/delay issue #8449 plus general (non CP) delayed write problems introduced by Sonoma. Apple may take a long time to fix this.


26:44 @foamyguy
* Added prompts and more flexibility for select tag and title for the automated release tool in Adabot
* Library PR testing and reviews: ADT7410 sensor and  new examples for HttpServer and LIS3MDL 
* Tried Blinka DisplayIO with PyGameDisplay and started working on changes required to get it back to working. Making progress, but not functional yet. 
* Look into the CircuitPython Org bundle building issue
* I’ll be streaming for the upcoming DeepDive on Friday.
* Look into Blinka Minecraft integration?


28:48 @makermelissa
* Last Week:
   * Wrote the Qualia RGB666 Product Guide
   * Created my first Fritzing Part
* This Week:
   * Add Bar display to Qualia RGB666 Guide
   * Work on GitHub issues
   * Test out more displays with Blinka Displayio such as the Pimoroni PHat and WHat displays
   * Likely some guide updates


## 29:32 In The Weeds


29:45 @foamyguy 
Template library discussed in the weeds a few weeks back is ready for release https://github.com/FoamyGuy/Adafruit_CircuitPython_TemplateEngine is any one able to create the repo for it? Or is there some process for moving the ownership of the repo?

## 32:46 Wrap-Up
