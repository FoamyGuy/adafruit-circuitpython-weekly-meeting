GitHub posts that there are now officially more than 100 million developers using GitHub to build, maintain, and contribute to software projects. They look a bit at what that means going forward - GitHub and Adafruit Blog.


### 05:53 Project of the Week: A CubeSat using CircuitPython and MicroPython
 CubeSat 

First and second year engineering students at Harlow College (Harlow, Essex, UK) have been busy designing and building a new CubeSat platform, with the ultimate aim of getting their boards and designs in space, taking photos of the Earth and beaming them back to the classroom.
The CubeSat platform is based around the Raspberry Pi Pico, consisting of three parts to the design: an acquisition board loaded with a camera and various sensors and storage; a master controller board with a radio link; and a ground station containing a radio link and decoder software. All three boards use the Raspberry Pi Pico, and the software is written with a mix of MicroPython and CircuitPython across the three boards - Adafruit Blog.


### 06:49 circuitpython-upload
circuitpython-upload is a simple uploader script for the CircuitPython web workflow. Basically, call it with a hostname and password and it'll compare the local directory with the remote and upload newer files.- GitHub via Mastodon.

* @danh for the “Building CircuitPython” guide which got me building CircuitPython in no time


## 26:04 Status Updates
@foamyguy (hosting)
* Last week:
   * Wrapped up the remaining open ethernet PRs
   * Worked on a game_controller library that provides a common interface for interacting with the most commonly used game inputs (Dpad / joystick and a few other action buttons). So far It supports the following devices: PyGamer, PyBadge, PewPew M4, Pico System, and the Joy Featherwing with any Feather.
   * Implemented draw_line and boundary_fill for blinka_displayio bitmaptools
* This week
   * Starting to try to wrap my head around the different available classes and modules for the IS31FL3741 LED driver. I’m trying to figure out how each component is meant to be used and what will be the “path of least resistance” for using the driver with the led_animation library. There is an existing example for the LED Glasses, but not one for the Matrix. I’ve tried out a few proposed solutions that do work, but still want to spend some more time to get a better understanding of how and why they work and see if it’s possible to do in a more minimal and generic way. Also try to look into the difference between the core implementation vs. the python one.
   * Investigate OnDiskBitmap vs. Imageload for displaying bmp files. @carter found an image that displays differently between the two, which is something I’ve never seen before and am interested in digging to try to understand.


29:02 @danh
* Scott, Jeff, and I triaged the remaining 8.0.0 bugs and pushed a couple forward to 8.x.x.
* I released CircuitPython 8.0.0-rc.1 on Sunday. rc.0 was missing a PR so I discarded it. 8.0.0-rc.1 can’t be final, there is a ReadTheDocs fix PR that is now already merged. There may be a few more minor tweaks. We’ll see if we need an rc.2
* Did testing for 32MB ESP32-S3 build for MicroDev as they tweaked it. Successful PR is in rc.1.
* Hardware debugging: not CircuitPython: STEMMA power control, BOOTPROT




32:37 @David.Glaude (text only)
* CP:
   * Reading all the #CircuitPython2023 (except mine) and sometimes commenting on them.
   * Watching CP (and other adafruit) streams (and participating when LIVE).
   * Instinct acquisition of an ESP32-C6-DevKitC-1-N8 before I figured that CP support would not be before long (but I am ready).
   * Temporary put on hold my attempt to read my C64 keyboard (at one point it did send so many random keystrokes that my PC crashed).
* Non CP:
   * Decided to re-install BCM64 (C64) to validate my pinout of my keyboard.
   * Added Joystick 1 and 2 support to my Raspberry Pi board for BCM64.


33:41 @DJDevon3 (text only)
* Finished the TR-Cowbell enclosure. There are some small alignment issues. Had to use a mallet to fit everything together. The top faceplate has space for a 1.5” tall display. It won’t fit the larger PyPortal or TFT Featherwing sized displays. You will of course be able to use the files to modify the design to suit your needs.
*   * F3D, STL, OBJ and other formats for the enclosure now available on my github.  
* If you do not have a 3D printer you can use these files to have one printed for you. I cannot offer an enclosure to everyone. Too many people have them now, it would take me months of printing.


34:44 @jepler
   * Not much CP activity last week
   * Worked on creating a text terminal using picodvi & arduino
   * Responded to guide feedback & improved a few guides in tiny ways
   * Posted the first mouse guide, for the NeXT computers mouse. At least one more mouse project is in the works.
   * This week:
   * Still hoping to test out the esp32 riscv ulp on this keyboard project
   * Taking a look at i2sout on esp32s2/3 just to see how well/poorly it’s working.
   * Other stuff:
   * My spouse gets back from her month long trip in india & nepal this week


36:17 @Jose David (text only)
   * Last week
   * A couple of documentation pros reviews 
   * Updated the community library driver list adding their description and documentation link if missing
   * Work in the TMP117 sensor library for memory optimization
   * Work in a new example for the JLed community library which allows non blocking LEDs sequences and effects adding a magnetometer example for a led to increase decrease brightness if a magnet is close by 
   * Some type annotations PR
   * Work in releasing some personal libraries in PyPI. Gladly surprised that other people than me download them 
   * This week
   * Maybe to work on the TMP117 memory issue
   * Update the community library helpers list description
   * Take a look at other community libraries and see what they can do. 


37:25 @gneverov
   * Working on Issue 7452: r2pio.StateMachine non-polling read


37:52 @kattni
   * Last week:
   * Various misc.
   * Meeeeeetings.
   * Fixed up EYESPI guide templates to show all usable pins
   * Worked with Alec to fix a CI thing on Adafruit BLinka bleio library
   * This week:
   * Reverse TFT Feather guide
   * Time lapse RPi 
   * CH9102F guide update
   * Metro Mini guide update
   * More various misc.
   * Unrelated:
   * One of my air plants bloomed, and the blooms are already on their way out.
   * The second one is beginning to show signs of blooming. I’m hoping to stay on top of this one with photos.


40:34 @makermelissa
   * Last Week:
   * Worked mostly on fixing up my PR for code.circuitpython.org which should improve USB workflow
   * I also separated out my JavaScript code that interfaces with the CircuitPython REPL over a serial connection
   * Helped a user troubleshoot their BrainCraft driver install on Bullseye
   * This Week:
   * Working on getting an initial version of the CircuitPython Installer running
   * Currently working on addressing CORS issues and have a plan at this point
   * Need to update the GitHub actions for tinyuf2 so it uploads to Amazon S3
   * Need to Add Info for new Release Candidate Boards to circuitpython.org
   * Updating guides/drivers for revised 0.96” TFT
   * Looked at esptool-js and it looks like it’s really close to being able to use over out ESPTool, so I will probably do some testing with that soon


42:15 @mark(gamblor) [ lurking ]
   * Started work and investigated adding gif output support. Hoping to get a proof of concept written up this week time permitting.


42:33 @tannewt
   * Wrapped up #CircuitPython2023 last Monday after the meeting. https://blog.adafruit.com/2023/01/23/circuitpython2023-wrap-up/
   * Sent out a PR for Bangle.js 2 support + 7-color epaper support. Will follow up with changes for it.
   * Created a repo for the display-ruler example image with the GIMP source image. https://github.com/adafruit/display-ruler
   * Looking to finish usb host support on imx rt.
   * Will also be looking to scorpio as a logic analyzer.


44:48 @tekktrik (text only)
   * Last couple weeks
   * PR reviews
   * More type annotation PRs
   * At least 1 new Community bundle addition, woohoo!
   * Others that I’m forgetting, but a belated group hug to everyone who contributes!
   * Updated the report to combine the Adafruit and Community Bundle updates
   * Updated and patched the CI for more deprecation warnings in the libraries and Blinka ecosystem
   * Please tag, message, or ping me if you find any additional CI deprecation issues since I am assuming I’ve found them all by now!
   * Created a new GitHub Action to replace one in the core with deprecation warnings
   * Fun getting to revisit JavaScript after ~15 years, personally hoping to making some cool stuff with the OctoKit API
   * Taking some personal time to help care for my partner
   * This week
   * Trying to finalize all the CI updates
   * Hopefully working on feature additions and bug fixes for a few libraries I have the hardware for now that the CI is (mostly) patched
   * Feasibility testing for some library updates like issues and PR templates that I can suggest next if they work and make sense
## 46:21 In The Weeds
46:49 @tekktrik (text only)
   * Whenever there are updates to things like the CI or cookiecutter templated items (e.g., README), Adafruit libraries are patched but community bundle libraries can lag behind.  Sometimes, gaining the improvements is more relevant to Adafruit libraries, but there are times where community bundle libraries should benefit if those libraries are still maintained (such as GitHub Actions CI updates).  I’m exploring ways to have said updates visible to the community at large and have said fixes and improvements readily understood, since these issues are potentially rediscovered months after Adafruit libraries have had them fixed.
   * I’ve thought about releasing git patches to make fixes available or allowing automated PRs, but this depends on the repository already being at a specific state.  Additionally, git patches aren’t always applicable (e.g., you couldn’t change circup installation instructions because every library is different) and repositories vary greatly so PR automation is a major challenge.
   * Would a rolling blog-like format be better, explaining issues and their fixes?  Should it be more newsletter-like, where individuals can subscribe to get updates?  Just brainstorming and looking for ideas!


52:09 @tannewt
   * #CircuitPython2023 discussion


57:39 @mark(gamblor) [ hopefully will be here? ]
   * Quick question about adding external libraries. Found a gif library (AnimatedGIF) that is small and works well (used in some Adafruit Arduino projects). It is Apache licensed so not sure if there are any concerns?
## 59:38 Wrap-Up
This was one of the most attended meetings we’ve had in a while!
Next meeting is at the normal time, Monday February 6, 2023, at 2pmET/11amPT.
