### The IEEE Spectrum Top Programming Languages for 2023
[IEEE Spectrum Top Programming Languages](../assets/20230918/20230918ieee.jpg)](https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-top-programming-languages-2023)
In the latest IEEE Spectrum ranking of the top programming languages, Python and Java are on top with Python the leader by a considerable margin - [IEEE Spectrum](https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-top-programming-languages-2023).
> "Python has become the jack-of-all-trades language—and the master of some, such as AI, where powerful and extensive libraries make it ubiquitous. And although Moore’s Law is winding down for high-end computing, low-end microcontrollers are still benefiting from performance gains, which means there’s now enough computing power available on a US $0.70 CPU to make Python a contender in embedded development."
### 3:19 CircuitPython 8.2.6 Released

**Notable changes to 8.2.6 since 8.2.5**
* Updated the TLS root certificates to support servers using Let’s Encrypt.
### 4:05 Limor "Ladyada" Fried Interviewed on The Pi Cast
The Tom's Hardware Pi Cast on September 12th featured Limor "Ladyada" Fried from Adafruit. They discuss "Writing Arduino Drivers With AI" - [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZwBl_HNvJk).
> Writing libraries to support our favorite microcontrollers is a big task, but what if ChatGPT could lend a hand? Adafruit's own Limor "Ladyada" Fried has tasked ChatGPT to write Arduino drivers in her own style, creating a "mini-Limor" bot to handle the task. We sat down with Fried to talk about how AI can help Adafruit and the wider community to write drivers, and improve workflows.

## 13:19 Hug reports


@danh (hosting)
* GIGANTIC hugs to @kattni for your work on CircuitPython, guides, libraries, and the community over the past seven or so years. You shepherded this community to the excellent state it is in today, brought on board many people who now volunteers or are paid to work on CircuitPython or the community, and kept a clear vision of what the community should be. We will miss you greatly!
* @eightycc for redoing the HID library timeouts so devices will wait patiently until the host is ready
* @jepler for pair merging


15:13 @2231puppy (text only)
* Just a group hug!


15:21 @carter (text only)
* @FoamyGuy For pushing some final code tweaks and merging a semi-stalled PR for fixing an EMC2101 library import issue.
* @danh For time spent (unfortunately wasted) helping chase a weird PyPortal issue that ended up just being a bad SD card.
* @kattni For all the years of amazing contributions to the CircuitPython community and everything else you helped with at Adafruit. happy_trails.show()


15:52 @CGrover (text only)
* @Kattni for preparing to write a new chapter after years of enthusiastically bolstering the CircuitPython community. You set the standard for tireless and empathetic community participation that we can only hope to emulate. I’ve grown as a contributor largely due to your help and example. The best of luck to you as you turn the page.
* @DJDevon3 for the amazing and somewhat overwhelmingly huge RGB panel project. Besides conquering the mysteries of extending CircuitPython to make it work, the 36-ampere power supply capacity is getting close to what a welder might need.
* @JohnPark for the new fundamental synthio learning guide. It clearly explains the basics of how to make synthio do its thing. The symbolic nomenclature used is perfect for documenting and sharing synthesizer configuration and operation.
* To whoever came up with the idea for the Playground notes section of the Adafruit Learning Guide system, thank you! I published a few project documents out there to give it a try.


17:03 @DJDevon3
* @MakerMelissa for advice on cherry picking MatrixPortal library layers to avoid unnecessary overhead.
* @Tannewt for an interesting stream on merging ESP-IDF into the core
* @FoamyGuy for a great Saturday morning stream on working with html templates
* @Kattni for her last week as Discord admin. You’ve been absolutely stellar for everything you've done behind the scenes. I’ll miss fearing you more than Dynobot.


18:05 @foamyguy
* @kattni Thank you for all of the work you’ve put into the project and community + all of the help you gave me when I joined adafruit and got spun up.
* @michaelpokusa for continued work and coordination on templating library
* Group hug


18:38 @jepler
* Kattni, be seeing you. Keep the channels of communication open with this community & with me personally! You’ve been a tremendous force for good in this community, and that’s even before I account for the fact that probably 90% of what you have done simply goes unnoticed. Well, now we will notice.
* Dan, thanks for your work on the merge. I look forward to being of assistance as I can. 
* Dan, thanks for agreeing to take on extra discord responsibilities
* Big hug report to the Micropython developers. CircuitPython is a friendlyfork of micropython. Besides supporting Adafruit through hardware purchases, you can support Micropython through the github sponsors feature: https://github.com/sponsors/micropython
* Group hug


19:32 @kattni
* Group hug to everyone. This community is a huge part of what started this chapter in my life, and my involvement with it has been one of the most fulfilling and amazing things I’ve done over the last seven years. I was the source of “code + community = CircuitPython”. Phil showed up on Discord early on asking for help coming up with a tagline. There were a lot of excellent snake-related ideas, but to me, the thing that drew me to it was the community. I ended up typing up a pretty long message explaining how important the community was to me, and how critical it was to my involvement. CircuitPython made coding approachable to me, but the community provided a safe and welcoming place to learn more about it. Code + Community = CircuitPython. I believe this is still a completely valid statement. So… thank you for being amazing, thank you for being a part of the welcoming, positive, supportive place that we’ve created together, and finally, thank you for welcoming me as a community leader and giving me the opportunity to gain the experience of building an open source community.
* @Community Moderators on Discord. Thank you for being an amazing mod team. This community would not be so safe and welcoming without you. We’ve built it to the point where we have little to do other than catch spammers, but that was not without an immense amount of work on all of your parts. I appreciate your help and your part in creating what we have.
* @Discord Helpers Keep being great. And don’t stop recommending new helpers. Everyone that has been recommended by one of you has eventually accepted, and it has worked out amazingly well. Thank you for being willing to be more visible in your respective spaces and for all the work you put into this community.
* @danh, @jepler, @tannewt Thank you for being a great team to work with and for all your help and support throughout the years. I would not have reached the levels I have without some nudging along the way from each of you.
* @liz I’m grateful for the opportunity to work directly with you on guides over the last nearly-a-year. You’re fantastic at what you do and I appreciate all the help you’ve given me with guide work, especially when I couldn’t think of good guide taglines.
* @anneb Thank you for all your personal support throughout the years. As much as the newsletter is a huge undertaking, I am glad that I was asked to take over it so you could take time away when you needed to, because it gave us the opportunity to work together. And thank you for picking up the blogs that I miss on a regular basis; I really do hate WordPress.
* @carter Thank you for always being willing to dive into a schematic with me or explain some fundamental electronics concept that I missed due to my learning path to get where I am. You always take the time to explain everything from the ground up, and I have learned so much from you.
* @MakerMelissa I am really glad I had the opportunity to meet you in person multiple times. I greatly appreciate your insight on things, and all the help you’ve given me with questions related to things in your wheelhouse. I am looking forward to you getting back into creating personal projects and posting videos.
* @tekktrik For always being available to jump into CI issues, being willing to break things, and perfectly happy to fix it. It’s been great to work with you, and I appreciate all of the CI and library help.
* @foamyguy Thank you for being up for helping out with pretty much everything I’ve come up with in the libraries, etc. Especially thank you for all the help with personal projects and ideas, such as my fantastic PyCon PyBadge this year that folks could interact with over wireless to change the LED colors, and play a snake game. It was everything I was hoping for.
* @Mr. Certainly Thank you for a million things, but especially for being so helpful with wording things. Your help with the Community Code of Conduct has been invaluable. It’s been so useful to be able to bounce things off of you, as you almost always have a better way to say it.
* Thank you to everyone I have met throughout the years, whether online or in person, and to everyone who has supported me in so many ways including, reading my guides, helping me with code and bugs, letting me know when something I suggested worked out, and so much more. One of the most amazing things has been you telling me your stories of how something I created or helped create had a positive impact on you or folks you know. I will still be a part of this community, albeit in a different capacity. Please don’t stop sharing your stories with those who have that sort of impact on you. It can end up meaning more than you know.
* To anyone I missed, know that you have not gone unnoticed… But my brain can only process so much at once, and this was already a lot. Thank you!  


23:58 @makermelissa
* @kattni I’m glad I was able to get to know you and wanted to thank you for encouraging me to try out some Live Streaming on CircuitPython day both last year and this year. I’m also glad about the opportunities we’ve had to work together on various things including attending PyCon together. I’m also glad we will be able to keep in touch.
* Group Hug


24:26 @mark(gamblor21) [ missing today ]
* @kattni for pushing and helping me to get involved as a reviewer, which led to my eventual contributions to libraries and then the core. For proactively reaching out to ensure roadblocks were removed. And for your countless guides I rely on weekly to help me with my own projects. I hope you still drop by the community from time to time to say hi!


24:49 @michalpokusa (text only)
* @FoamyGuy for help with testing the template engine, Saturday stream and Sunday pair programming session


25:02 @Paul Cutler (text only)
* @kattni for everything you’ve done for this community.  I can’t wait to see what you do next!


25:09 @tannewt
* @kattni Once again, you will be missed. CircuitPython and the community surrounding it wouldn’t be what it is today without you. You’ve managed the vast set of libraries and thats a core reason that folks come to CircuitPython. Thank you. I’m excited to see what you do next!
* @microdev for doing the hard work of the 5.0 merge.
## 26:03 Status Updates


26:32 @danh (hosting)
* Released CircuitPython 8.2.6 last week to add a certificate for Let’s Encrypt. It’s working.
* Worked a lot more on the MicroPython V1.20.0 merge. I had eight more tricky merge conflicts to do. Did “pair merging” with Jeff this morning to go over some that he has a lot more knowledge about. We did three and will continue in that vein later today or tomorrow. Once those are done I can finally do the first commit of the merge and then we can start trying builds. I may also do a second pass through the changes; that was helpful last time.


27:44 @2231puppy (text only)
* Got KiCad running on Android- https://2231puppy.tech/posts/personal-setup/kicad-on-android/
* Continued working on the E-Fidget. It’s almost time for version 6!


28:08 @CGrover (text only)
* Released the code for the “windless” IoT Weather Chimes project. A summary is available here: https://adafruit-playground.com/u/CGrover/pages/iot-weather-chimes-using-synthio
* Built a few MatrixPortal twister adapter PCBs (from OSH Park, of course). The PCBs allow a MatrixPortal board to be turned 180 degrees so that it will be completely contained within the RGB display panel’s shadow rather than sticking out on one end, essential for mounting the panel in a picture frame. https://adafruit-playground.com/u/CGrover/pages/matrixportal-board-twister-hub75-adapter
* Rebuilt the remaining physical patio wind chimes using 1/32” stainless steel cable and crimp ferrules rather than nylon fishing leader. Didn’t realize there was a system of cable and ferrules of that size out there. I’ve been living under a rock. https://adafruit-playground.com/u/CGrover/pages/wind-chime-repair


28:59 @DJDevon3
* Last week
   * Went from 4 matrix panels to 9 driven by the Matrix Portal S3
   * Fixed a driver with OpenAI on a new ST7796S display to refresh in landscape mode.
   * Went on Show & Tell with 12 matrix panels that were jumbled out of order as a surprise progress update. Unfortunately it didn’t work due to incorrect ordering.
* This week
   * Figured out why the 12 panels were out of order. The RGBMatrix driver is extremely particular about the placement of the first panel in the serpentine order. I’m extremely happy with 12 panels. I might attempt to add more, for science, because I haven’t hit the limit yet.
   * Created a quick graphic for someone on Discord to easily differentiate between a QT Py ESP32-S3 with 8MB Flash/no PSRAM vs 4MB Flash/2MB PSRAM. They are visually identical except for the model printed on the chip that you need a magnifying glass to read. Liz asked to use the graphic in the QT Py ESP32-S3 Learn Guide so I cleaned up the image for a better illustration. Credit to @Todbot for spotting the difference, I just made a graphic for it.
   * Finished 3D printing 26 brackets for the 12 panel LED matrix and will be going on Show & Tell this week with a working demo of 12 panels. The code between using 4 panels vs 12 panels is identical except for height, width, and tile (column) count.


30:53 @foamyguy
* Last week

   * The ESP32S3 LCD EV kit now boots to a display, thanks to this code
   * Even coded in C it takes a fair bit of time to send the initialization code, hmph!
   * Small improvements to rgbmatrix documentation in readthedocs
* This week
   * Two open core PRs to get to completion
   * Helping dan with merge as needed
   * A bit late to the party, but I’ll be giving belated feedback on the synthio guide.
* Soon:
   * OUT starting October 4 — first day back to work November 13
   * Are you in/near any of these cities? Want to show me around or just meet for a cup of coffee while I’m on vacation? @ me. Lisbon, Coimbra, Porto, Faro, Seville, Cadiz, Granada, Madrid
34:52 @kattni
* Last week
   * Metro M7 SD guide in moderation.
* This week
   * Any fixes to issues found in the guide during moderation
   * Wrapping everything up
   * Offboarding
   * Final day contracting with Adafruit is Friday September 22


35:33 @makermelissa
* Last Week:
   * Worked on GitHub issues with a focus on Blinka-related ones
   * Updated the RA8875 Learn Guide 
* This Week:
   * Continue going through and paring down GitHub issues


35:56 @tannewt
* 5.0 merge is pretty much ready for PR. Just have to follow up on idf change feedback.
* Started 5.1 merge on my stream last week and it looks pretty minor. IIRC I have it working on S3 and want to get C6 and H2 going.


## 37:04 In The Weeds


37:38 @2231puppy (text only)
* I love Mu, but it’s pretty beginner-oriented. I’d love to see an officially endorsed VSCode/other editor extension for CircuitPython that’s a little more capable. The existing one is a little buggy and doesn’t have official backing from Adafruit. I’m sure full support for VSCode (as in helping people with it) is too much to ask, but having a CircuitPython editor setup for more advanced users would be much appreciated.
   * (Paul Cutler) PyCharm with circuitpython-stubs works well:  https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/pycharm-and-circuitpython 


39:36 @jepler - what if we abolish i2c bus locking
* Doing this might put i2c bus expanders (that can work with background things like keypad) back on track
* Spi bus locking makes sense because there is a settable frequency and because it has to be undertaken in sync with changes to device CS pins
* I2c bus has no CS pin or settable frequency
* Only stm and broadcom ports call `RUN_BACKGROUND_TASKS` in common-hal/busio/I2C, so preempting long I2C transactions has not been seen as necessary. These calls would have to be removed, because they’d allow a background I2C transaction (e.g., from displayio) to occur during a foreground one.
* Before write_then_readinto, locking may have been needed for “repeated start” transactions”
* Try_lock and unlock can be left as no-operations for a transitional period
* @danh
   * if we ever implemented pre-emptive multitasking (probably threads), would we need locking?
   * Could locking be invisible to the Python API?


58:43 @michalpokusa (text only) - Next steps with templating engine library
* Some time ago FoamyGuy did try implementing “utemplate” library to work with CircuitPython and the adafruit_httpserver library
* Due to the API exposed by the “utemplate”, the whole process required some not so obvious steps and some boilerplate code in order to make it work
* Over the last two weekends me and FoamyGuy have worked on the prototype of a Django-like templating engine with more intuitive API
* There are plans for creating examples in HTTPServer that show it’s usage with the templates
* In the current state, it seems like it is ready to be released as v1.0.0
* The main question is: Is it possible to release it as e.g. “adafruit_template_engine” as part of the main bundle? It is closely related to adafruit_httpserver, but also could be used independently. That is why for now it was not added as another module of HTTPServer.
   * Main reason for this is purely the repository owner aspect, as in other bundles, if I am correct, I would be the owner, thus requiring me to adapt to the docs generation methods and keeping Actions up to date etc.
* If the main bundle is not the correct place for it, should it be added to Community Bundle or the CircuitPython Bundle?
   * FoamyGuy suggested adding the Adafruit as Collaborator to my repo, which would allow others than me to publish changes without me accepting the PR
   * From the two, Community bundle seems like a better choice, as I would say the e.g. “csv” module present the bundle offers a somewhat similar set of functionalities, meaning that it could be used in multiple scenarios and is not directly connected with specific board/sensor etc.
* Regardless of the bundle that it should go to, the second question is: What should be the next steps for releasing it? https://learn.adafruit.com/creating-and-sharing-a-circuitpython-library
