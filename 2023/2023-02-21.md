### Raspberry Pi Debug Probe: a plug-and-play debug kit for $12


Raspberry Pi launched the Raspberry Pi Debug Probe, a complete debug hardware solution for Arm-based microcontrollers, powered by RP2040, and priced at just $12 – [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-debug-probe-a-plug-and-play-debug-kit-for-12/).
The Raspberry Pi Debug Probe provides:
* A USB to Serial Wire Debug (SWD) bridge
* A generic USB serial adapter
* Cables to connect to a host computer, and to the debug target
While it has been designed with Raspberry Pi Pico, and other RP2040-based targets, in mind, the Raspberry Pi Debug Probe can be used to debug any Arm-based microcontroller that provides an SWD port with 3V3 I/O.

## 19:51 Status Updates
20:31 @danh (hosting)
* Made a UF2 SAMD21 bootloader that enables brownout detection very early. Now being tested.
* safemode.py merged and will be in 8.1.0. I’m writing a Guide.
* A user found a serious UART bug in 8.0.2 on QT Py M0: TX didn’t work. This bug has existed since 8.0.0-alpha.1. Made a fix which I will put in 8.0.3.
* Made a HUZZAH32 breakout (ESP32) board def, which will be useful for generic ESP32 boards. Will be in 8.1.0-beta.<first>


21:52 @DJDevon3 
* Batch 2 of the TR-Cowbells shipped today. If any components are missing please let me know. Got some small 4”x12” cardboard boxes to make the packaging a little more respectable and rugged with bubble wrap.
* Completed my first Printables Make which is Brent Rubell’s IoT Gmailbox. While the code in the learn guide is deprecated due to Gmail’s API no longer working, the 3D printing files made the physical project very easy. It’s an adorable little mailbox. The small flag design is honestly easy to miss so I want something bigger & louder that will definitely get my attention.
* Currently I’m printing a full size mailbox in clear PETG as a test of my 3D printer’s full build volume capability, the largest print I’ve attempted yet. Estimated time for the print is about 90 hours or close to 4 days. 
*   * It will use an ESP32-S2 with RFM95 featherwing and TFT display for an all-in-one notifier. It will notify snail mailbox activity from outside and will use Liz’s Octoprint & MQTT integration for 3D print status. Stuffing Neopixels in the translucent mailbox should look pretty and get my attention when it triggers.
*   * Animated Gif for Anne B.
* I might add an amplifier with large speakers and carry it on my shoulder… ever heard of a BoommailBox? The larger the enclosure the more possibilities become available. The STL files will be available on my Github and my Printables page when I’m sure the design works.
* Created a 3D printer bed calibrator PCB based on the E-Leveler PCB by CHEP on Youtube. Most modern auto bed leveling (ABL) and mesh based sensors do not work as well as advertised and I find myself continually having to retram the bed manually anyway. Checking nozzle height with a sheet of paper based on arbitrary feel can introduce human error, instead it uses a switch with an LED. Results are more consistent and repeatable for manual bed leveling. The PCB design is available on my Github as the Bedibrator.


25:19 @gneverov
   * Continuing to explore async API options, in the context of audio out
   * Working on playing audio via streaming over network as a proof-of-concept of async API.


26:10 @jepler
   * Last week: OV5640 breakout guide – currently in moderation
   * Friday: took a look at picodvi text mode, didn’t get anything working. May still be in a state of flux, haven’t checked with phil b yet
   * This week: floppy featherwing guide
   * How extensively to cover using GW/fluxengine?
   * Will cover arduino msd sketch and raw fluxing
   * Will cover circuitpython MFM and raw fluxing
   * There are some other upcoming products that I’ll start to do testing & coding on once those things are wrapped up or when I need a break from learn land


27:48 @Jose David (not in the meeting)
   * Last week
   * Small doc improvement for the PCA9685
   * Testing some displays
   * PR to add the temperature reading feature for the MLX90393 Magnetometer
   * Work in an example for the community library CSV that helps you deal with csv files easily
   * Some small testing
   * This week
   * Community libraries discover
   * Work on the `verbose`option for display_text library


28:26 @makermelissa
   * Last Week:
   * Finished up the majority of the CircuitPython Installer
   * This includes hunting down and fixing a bug where the flashing would lock up
   * This Week:
   * Finish up the PR for the CP Installer
   * Make any last minute bug fixes to the installer
   * Probably focus a bit on getting some of the slightly bigger GitHub issues fixed
   * Possibly work on a small JavaScript library or function that is able to combine binary files similar to esptool’s merge_bin function


29:00 @tannewt
   * Need to reply to Dan on Bangle.js PR.
   * Mostly working on PWMOut on iMX RT.
   * Working on an “Implementer’s Guide to CircuitPython API” with module-by-module info and test scripts.
   * Going to briefly look into performance counters on M7 to verify memory setup.


30:52 @tekktrik (not in meeting)
   * Last week
   * Figured out how to get a filesystem working in rp2040js
   * Pushed example code upstream
   * Removed the stats page from circuitpython.org since it was defunct
   * Updated some of my own libraries to keep the infrastructure up to date
   * This week
   * Creating a GitHub Action for rp2040js to look how library changes affect RAM usage
   * Currently sick so we’ll see how much gets done
