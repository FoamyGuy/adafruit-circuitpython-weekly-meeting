Driving Large LCD Displays with CircuitPython
 Driving "Dot Clock" Displays 

Adafruit now has the Espressif ESP32-S3 talking to large "dot clock" displays like the 7 inch 800x480 display above. There will be a display driver board with the S3 soon along with a selection of displays including rectangular, circular, and square - X, formerly Twitter and YouTube.
Project of the Week: Driving Five LED Displays with Python
 Driving 5 LED Displays 

Pimoroni writes "What if I told you this 96cm wide, five panel, 160x32 Interstate75 powered pixel display can be started for just £105 and driven from Python running on a Pi or desktop PC for impressively smoooth demos?"

## 12:22 Hug reports


12:36 @jepler (host)
* Group hug
* Tannewt for keeping my standards high in the dot clock TFT pull request
* So many community members submitting PRs, especially on the core
* Dan and brent for working through the certificates issues, and Dan for the 8.2.x update that should be coming soon so it’s resolved for our users


13:12 @anecdata (text only)
* @todbot for identifying my serial port in use when trying to update an nrf bootloader


13:22 @CGrover (text only)
* @DJDevon for the weather livestream during Hurricane Idalia using a very creative approach to layering desktop and development board images. It was very helpful to see all the data and images on one screen.
* @todbot for the synthio foundational and invaluable hints and tricks page. Made it easy to start from scratch and get something special running right away.


13:50 @danh
* Brent and Justin for discussion of certificate issues.
* @clever for ongoing broadcom port work.


14:19 @DJDevon3
* @CircuitPythonDevelopers dealing with the ESP-IDF merge issues. It seems like all of you need a big hug as things start breaking and issues start piling up heading into 9.0 All of your efforts are appreciated and seen.
* @RetiredWizard for uploading a 9.0 alpha build for the Matrix Portal S3 in the SSL handshake bug discussion on github. Was able to get my project on Show & Tell last week due to your kindness. Thank you!
* @CGrover & @Todbot for stopping by and saying hello during my Hurricane Idalia livestream.
* @Group Hug


15:04 @david.glaude (unable to attend):
* Group hug to all the organizers, streamers and participants to the CircuitPython Day.
* @Neradoc for the work on non-QWERTY non-US keyboard. I have to use that for HID output, and also for USB Host keyboard input.
* @FoamyGuy and whoever contributed to the CP_HTTP_Server library. Very interesting PR review stream in presence of the PR author.


15:46 @kattni
* Group hug


15:54 @Kmatch (unable to attend)
* @jepler and @RetiredWizard for sharing your binaries for the ESP32-S3 DotClockDisplay boards. 
* Hugs to all!


16:09 @makermelissa
* @jepler for creating a PR to remove frozen libs for the 8.2.x branch
* @danh for answering a question I had while being out
* @brent for reviewing a PR I made while Anne was out
* Group Hug


16:31 @michalpokusa (text only)
* @FoamyGuy for their “Deep Dive” and review of PR on adafruit_httpserver


16:41 @Paul Cutler
* @todbot for helping me with some code for my new MatrixPortal project.  
* @Tyeth for helping me - and a lot of others - this past week with Adafruit IO.  The help has been invaluable.


16:59 @tannewt
* @eightycc for adding memorymap support for RP2.
* @foamyguy for filling in for me on deep dive.


17:22 @todbot (unable to attend)
* @CGrover for really cool “CircuitPython_Chime” library that’s doing interesting chime algorithms in synthio
## 17:35 Status Updates
17:51 @jepler (host)
* Working on dot clock displays
* They work really well, within reason. However, there are limitations. Some may get better when we update esp-idf
* I have to check that 2 more displays work and address PR comments, and after that I think it’s done!
   * It will potentially change the way we interact with esp-idf for allocating psram, but it’s a good change IMO
   * If only because it means 0 changes to the esp_lcd library inside esp-idf are needed for us
* Need to plan with scott & dan. I had planned to do the 1.20 merge but will be unavailable in October. Scott, Dan & I will be discussing our options this week


19:32 @CGrover (text only)
* Finished the windless IoT Weather Chimes project after an intense session with physical garden wind chimes to develop a realistic wind speed effect algorithm. Learned a bunch about wind chime physics and the influence of the breeze.
   * Weather Chimes repo: https://github.com/CedarGroveStudios/Weather_Chimes
   * Project video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85vy7aG6j2c
* Need to repair a few more patio wind chimes before characterizing the scales, overtones, and strike envelopes later this week. We have a lovely-sounding copper chime and some nearly percussive ceramic bells that would be fun to model. Given our local weather, wind chimes (and windsocks, flags, garbage cans, and trampolines) get quite a bit of wind-related abuse.
* Getting interested in continuing along the chime voice path to develop realistic synth voices in synthio such as plucked string instruments (particularly the banjo and upright bass), as well as flutes and clarinets – without resorting to waveform samples. The next experiment will be to use a note envelope object to adjust a note’s filter as the note is played in order to create more complex sounds.
* My spouse observed that I was spending a lot of time on physical and electronic chimes the past few weeks. That’s not a secret message that needs decoding, is it? The project did get me out on the patio for a few hours.


21:03 @danh
* Returned from vacation.
* Working on a CircuitPython 8.2.x release with better roots.pem.
* Will talk to @jepler and @tannewt about MicroPython v1.20 merge and ESP-IDF v5.x update.


21:56 @DJDevon3
* Got 6 matrix panels working with the Matrix Portal S3 for a display size of 128x96.  I’m very happy with 6 as it makes a nice big display for my wall. Will be getting a couple more panels and a 2nd 5V 18A PSU to see how many more it can drive.
* Live streamed Hurricane Idalia data Friday night. Used a PicoDVI, BME280, & OBS with overlay data from NOAA, local radar, and my AdafruitIO dashboard. This was the main reason I purchased the PicoDVI. When you live in Florida the next hurricane is just a matter of time.
*   

23:32 @david.glaude (unable to attend):
   * Keyboard (and doing nothing? week
   * I did not do much, or I don’t remember anything.
   * I investigated Neradoc keyboard library, documentation and generation website and the 200+ keyboard mapping supported by Windows 11.
   * I tested native support for Keyboard on the USB Host port (Keyboard workflow) previous attempt failed because you have to power with a GPIO toggle the USB port on the Feather RP2040 USB Host.
   * I could not locate the documentation on:
   * How to detach the keyboard it you don’t want it to output in the REP?
   * How to change the keyboard mapping?
Any hint in the chat is welcome, else I need to watch the right deepdive where it was discussed.


24:07 @kattni
   * Put the EYESPI Pi Beret guide in moderation
   * Starting the Metro M7 microSD guide.


25:16 @makermelissa
   * Last Week:
   * Finished up the MatrixPortal S3 Message Board guide
   * Went through 5 Home Assistant guides and updated to use CircuitPython 8 and the updated Home Assistant syntax
   * Tested each of those projects
   * Started going through GitHub issues
   * This week:
   * Continue going through GitHub issues


25:50 @Paul Cutler
   * Finished my first S3 MatrixPortal project - when I choose an album on my Python web app, it downloads and converts the cover art, including gamma correction, for the album and sends a MQTT message.  The MatrixPortal waits for the message and then downloads and displays the album art on a 64x64 RGB matrix. I blogged about it here:  https://paulcutler.org/posts/2023/09/matrixportal-album-art-display/ 
   * Starting my second S3 MatrixPortal project - I have a mic plugged into a Raspberry Pi which records a sample from my speakers and uses shazamio in Cpython to identify the song.  I want to then send the song and artist data to a 32x64 matrix to display.  Having some issues with MQTT blocking and don’t have async working yet.


26:36 @tannewt
   * Moved into new office space. Not fully settled but computers are up and running.
   * Will be continuing work on the ESP IDF 5 update. Still getting the sdkconfig updater improved and updating all boards sdkconfig.
## 28:02  In The Weeds
@makermelissa When does it look like we will create a CicuitPython 9.0 alpha release?


## 30:52 Wrap-Up
