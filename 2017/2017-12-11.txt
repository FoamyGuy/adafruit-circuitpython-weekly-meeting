discussion:

tdicola:
don't feel bad if you get corrected by the linter
vertical alignment for consts: disable temporarily
discussion of small variables

maybe download pylint into the repo rather than have it copied to each one
test runner tox for python
must be able to run pylint locally
inline disabled of pylint are good because they document the decision

todo: see if we can disable disables by number rather than name
