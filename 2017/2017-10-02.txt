The cat hissing and growling at ~<a class="yt-simple-endpoint style-scope yt-formatted-string" spellcheck="false" href="/watch?v=Aj_sh56biNA&amp;t=808s">13:28</a> is Scott's cat Spook having a seizure.  He muted discord so others couldn't hear it but the recording still had it. Spook's ok now but does this from time to time and is on meds for it.
