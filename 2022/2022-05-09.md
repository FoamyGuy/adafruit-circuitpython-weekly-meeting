RISC-V CEO seeks 'world domination' by winning over the likes of Intel
 RISC-V 

The CEO of RISC-V's governing body says she wants to nothing less than "world domination" for the rising open-source processor technology, but to do that, the nonprofit needs buy-in from a variety of organizations, even those steeped in dominant, proprietary architectures, such as x86 giant Intel.
RISC-V has more than 2,400 members to include companies, universities, and government-related entities - The Register.
MicroPython Port for the WCH-CH32V307 Microcontroller

I want to thank the following folks for all their work at the PyCon US 2022 CircuitPython Sprints: awordforthat, jcerise, matt-land, davclark, rmblau, sabadam32, ktkinsey37, and ryanskeith. Between them, they submitted 14 pull requests (listed below). While many ended up choosing “hard mode” libraries to work with, everyone was persistent and persevered. Everyone said they felt like they learned and accomplished something, which is the most important part of it to me.

   * PyCon US 2022!
   * Education Summit
   * Talk - slides: https://github.com/kattni/PyCon2022/blob/main/Edu_Summit_Talk_Content/Simplicity%20and%20Fun%20Learning%20with%20CircuitPython.pdf
   * Mini-sprints (Intro to CircuitPython, CPB [same as Open Spaces, basically, but shorter])
   * Open Spaces x 3
   * Introduction to CircuitPython on Circuit Playground Bluefruit
   * Scheduled 2 hours instead of 1 at the excellent suggestion of a community member ahead of time
   * Well attended, even relative to other open spaces - we were running out of room, 36 chairs in the room, and we gave up our own seats for attendees to make space for everyone.
   * 2 attendees wrote games for the CPB, and submitted them to the PyCon2022 repo: https://github.com/kattni/PyCon2022/tree/main/Attendee_Examples
   * Sprints x 2
   * 14 PRs from 8 new authors
   * Everyone felt like they learned a lot and accomplished something.
   * Many attended the first day, less on the second day. (As expected.)
   * Even though folks chose hard mode libraries, they all persisted, persevered, and succeeded.
   * Saw friends for the first time in 3 years, and it was more needed than I realised.
   * I made new friends, and met a bunch of amazing new people.
   * I felt like I was able to introduce many people to CircuitPython, get them interested, provide some of them with hardware to continue at home. 
   * Got caught up from being gone
   * Tested PyLeap
   * Closed some guide feedback
 * This week:
   * Teaching Liz how to create Fritzing objects (sorry ahead of time)
   * Guide feedback
   * PyLeap testing
   * Help Jeff with getting his library into the bundle, etc.
   * Write a guide page on differences between mpy, py and frozen modules, etc. Neradoc can link the frozen modules section on circuitpython.org

31:21 @makermelissa

   * Updated bootloaders on circuitpython.org
   * Updated Logging library to upload to PyPI
   * Updated AzureIoT library to use Logging as a dependency
   * Tested Blinka on the Raspberry Pi Pico running MicroPython for speed and attempted to optimize, but the changes weren’t anything noticeable
   * Tested and updated e-Ink guides to mention that only 24-bit BMPs can be used
   * Tested out 2.13” e-Ink bonnet and updated guide
   * Finally replaced the bulging battery in my laptop

 * This week: Continuing with the card deck library (getting into the displayio part now!), hopefully 2 Twitch streams


34:18 @tannewt
 * Last 6 weeks: many many diapers, burping and soothing a new baby. Lots of love.
 * This week:
   * Still lots of baby time. Will be sorting out my schedule this week. Will be taking 12 more weeks of leave when Becca goes back to work in August.
   * Ramping up on CP work
   * Let me know what things are high priority for you.
   * Will be switching the NTP library over to the native socket version I made.


36:37 @tekktrik (text-only / lurking)
 * Last week:
   * Reviewing PyCon PRs
   * Working on a script to standardize the .pre-commit-config.yaml files in the libraries, both content and formatting
   * Adding more links to tutorials, guides, and related reading to the documentation pages for CircuitPython core modules
   * Ordered the PCB for my auto-lighting menorah
 * This week:
   * Continuing to refactor the ATECC library - now have hardware to test
   * Adding more protocols to circuitpython_typing to aid in type libraries
   * Confirming the .pre-commit-config.yaml script is good to go and then patching the libraries
   * Maybe worth a discussion since it’s been recently made available on PyPI - should adafruit_logging be made a true subset of CPython’s logging?  Looking into the differences this week at least.
