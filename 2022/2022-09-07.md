Adafruit Adding CircuitPython Support for Raspberry Pi Pico W
 CircuitPython Support for Raspberry Pi Pico W 

The firmware UF2 for the Raspberry Pi Pico W LOOKS simple enough… on boot it blinks the onboard LED 3 times and then boots into CircuitPython 8. But, looks can be deceiving! The LED on the Pico W is not connected to a GPIO on the RP2040. It’s connected to a GPIO on the WiFi/BLE module! That blinking means that the bootloader is able to load firmware and communicate with the module in the CircuitPython firmware, an important first step to implementing the rest of the wireless stack. Soon, CircuitPython and the hundreds of libraries and IoT examples will be ready to run on the Pico W - Adafruit Blog, YouTube and Twitter.

## 16:24 Status Updates


17:00 @jepler (running meeting)
* Last week:
   * Pi Cow can associate with a WIFI network, retrieve its ipv4 address, etc. It can’t send or receive packets yet
   * Started adapting 4 vintage keyboards to USB HID with CircuitPython and RP2040. Done:
      * Commodore (8x8 matrix)
      * IBM Model F for original IBM PC (unidirectional clocked serial protocol)
      * Tandy 1000 (Different unidirectional clocked serial protocol)
      * Code for these three is posted on my blog already: https://emergent.unpythonic.net/01662257474
   * PR’d minor changes into adafruit-circuitpython-hid I encountered while working on this
* This week:
   * More of both of the above.
   * Pi Cow:
      * Investigate whether to bite the bullet and adopt FreeRTOS
      * Figure out why the DNS server address doesn’t seem to be set
      * Next milestone is to implement .ping() successfully
   * Keyboards:
      * Last keyboard will be hardest: ADB-era Apple Macintosh keyboard. This is a bidirectional clocked serial protocol.
      * Will be soldering up a few more adapters to get guide photos
      * Then it’ll be time to Learning System Guide all those keyboards
   * Traveling September 9-13, missing next Monday meeting


19:41 @danh
* Released CircuitPython 7.3.3.
* Getting status bar enabling/disabling to work right. Fixed a storage lifetime bug uncovered by the status bar code but not part of it.
* Lowering power during deep sleep on Espressif chips.
* Lots of 8.0.0 bugs still to fix.


20:59 @deshipu
* preparing for Makerfaire Hannover this weekend
* no progress on other things


21:37 @kattni
* This is the Neighbors Are Getting Their Roof Replaced edition of Kattni Status Updates (apologies for the noise)
* Last week:
   * Published the Install CircuitPython on ESP32 template, and added it to the Feather ESP32 V2 guide.
   * Started WiFi Mailbox Notifier guide
   * Submitted code to the Learn repo for the mailbox guide
* This week:
   * Finish Mailbox guide
      * overview is essentially done, but everything else is left to do, including getting build images. It is, at least, a very simple build.
      * Setup works with the new reed switches, so that’s good. (I hadn’t tested it with an actual switch until an hour before this meeting.) 
   * Won’t know what’s next until this guide is done.
* Basement Project: Part II
   * Picked out paint for the two rooms and outside-room walls in the basement
   * Looked more into basement floor sealing


23:47 @makermelissa
* Last Week:
   * Worked on adding some more features to code.circuitpython.org enough to push current changes to live website
   * Added a nice feature to transfer you work between devices and URLs
   * Added links for Full Code Editor to Web Workflow welcome screen and Documentation in the core
   * Created a couple of handy CircuitPython scripts to make switching between different WiFi networks much easier using just the console
   * Working on a Web Workflow Quickstart Guide that should be finished soon
* This Week:
   * Wrap up guide
   * Work on fixing some bugs I found while writing guide
   * Work on remaining features I’d like to add to the editor
   * First time hosting Show and Tell all by myself
* Other:
   * Finished moving out of my smaller office last week
   * Working on packing my larger office this month which involves reorganizing and soldering up all of my Adafruit boards so I can find them easily
