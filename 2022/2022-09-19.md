### 3:21 Arduino IDE 2.0 Was Finally Released
After a lengthy testing period, Arduino announced that Arduino IDE 2.0 has moved to stable and is [available for download](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software). It has a modern editor and provides a better overall user experience thanks to a responsive interface and faster compilation time - [Arduino](https://blog.arduino.cc/2022/09/14/its-here-please-welcome-arduino-ide-2-0/) and [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/09/14/arduino-ide-2-0-is-finally-released-arduino-arduino/).
### 4:01 Diode: Build and Program Projects in the Browser
Diode makes it easy to build, program, and run hardware projects in the browser. Save time and money waiting on parts, shorten feedback loops, and build hardware better. The syntax is Python. You can play with a very limited demo now - [Diode](https://www.withdiode.com/) via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/KennethCassel/status/1568327236662734848).
### 4:32 The CircuitPython Show
The CircuitPython Show is an independent podcast hosted by Paul Cutler, focusing on the people doing awesome things with CircuitPython. Each episode features Paul in conversation with a guest for a short interview – [CircuitPythonShow](https://circuitpythonshow.com/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/circuitpyshow).
The latest episode was released September 19th with guest Thea Flowers.  Thea shares how she discovered CircuitPython, her synthesizer company Winterbloom, and how her products use CircuitPython. – [Show List](https://circuitpythonshow.com/episodes/all).
### 5:09 Maker Becky Stern has a new Electronic Video Series for Digi-Key
Former Adafruit Director of Wearable Electronics Becky Stern has a new video series that she’s doing for [Digi-Key](https://www.digikey.com/). Becky has always done an outstanding job of explaining what can be intimidating technically in an entertaining and digestible way (like her [Adafruit Learning System guides](https://learn.adafruit.com/search?q=becky)).
If this first installment of the series ([playlist in progress](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7LFZxQcCQo&list=PLEBQazB0HUyTF7kB7v1S77F9QK0gT--Kt)), an [introduction to LEDs](https://youtu.be/i7LFZxQcCQo), is any indication, this series looks to deliver more of her welcome brand of accessible tech education. 
Check out the [first video](https://youtu.be/i7LFZxQcCQo) and an article on [BoingBoing](https://boingboing.net/2022/09/15/new-electronics-video-series-from-well-known-maker-becky-stern.html) - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/09/15/maker-becky-stern-does-new-electronic-video-series-for-digi-key-making-digikey-bekathwia/).

## 22:50 Status Updates


@danh (hosting)
* Added ability to preserve DigitalInOut state during deep sleep. Currently implemented on Espressif only.
* Researched and fixed several minor issues.
* Over the weekend, lots of furniture moving in the house to improve our home office situations. Also installed more carpet tiles, this time not involving a trip to the ER for stitches. Lots of computer updating, not all of which went well.


25:41 @CGrover (text only)
* Inspired by @foamyguy’s flip clock project, started working on a method to update a displayio Palette for setting chroma key (green screen) transparency. The quest required an unplanned detour into RGB Color Value Comparison Land. It’s a glowy place made vibrant with its three suns. I have a working algorithm in test that still needs a couple of tweaks. The next challenge is to provide a logical and user-friendly tolerance setting for reducing anti-aliasing edge artifacts (chart).
  



26:23 @david.glaude (text only or missing):
* Please scroll in the discord chat and vote for a name for a feature name in CircuitPython.org board selection: https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython-org/issues/1032
* Recovered and tested my pyusb code for the Buzzz “joystick”.
* Tested some Arduino usb_host examples (keyboard pass-through) for the Teensy.
* I was misled to believe that usb_host was supported in CircuitPython on Teensy 4.1 (by Twitter user River Wang @River___Wang and also by release notes of 7.3(?) ) … so I tried.
   * Then I watched one of the two DeepDives on the topic by Scott (@tannewt).
   * Then I found the issue #6527 that explains the status.
   * Then I watched 2 or 3 videos from @ATMakers (Bill Binko); now I want or replicate one of his USB Filter PCBs (two Trinkets back to back, or Trinket talking to RP2040 QTPy).


27:42 @DJDevon3
* Received a bunch of Adafruit’s new 3ft. magnetic USB-C cables and tips for my boards. These things are awesome! Worth noting you can use these as a practical replacement for an on/off switch on the Pi Pico. Highly recommend everyone add them to your arsenal. Adafruit just added Micro-B and iOS Lightning tips to the store on Wednesday. I would love to see some 6ft versions for headphones! 
* RFM messenger project got ignored/moved to the side this week.
* 16 step sequencer bell has taken all my attention this week. Poorly designed pull up circuit wasn’t allowing the I2C expanders to communicate to the Pico. Friday I ran bypass bodge wires to fix that. Sunday I thought some traces were touching that I missed during routing and now all 5 boards are paperweights. Just before the meeting figured out the footprint I used for the MCP expander chip has half of the pins backwards. Will be fixing all these issues in a new batch of prototype boards. Eventually when I have working prototypes I intend to give them away to whomever wants one. Developers and Pythonistas get first dibs. A busy yet unsuccessful week here. That’s all.


30:20 @foamyguy
* Last week
   * PR Reviews and testing
   * Typing, docstrings and cleanup of the FlipClock widget
   * Learn about typer and use it to make the FlipClock animation spritesheet generator into a CLI tool with optional arguments for all configuration options
* This week
   * Gather notes and helpful scripts used for various library bundle bulk automated tasks into one repo and add a readme with high level information and steps to use them
   * Generate Flip clock sprites with different fonts, and perhaps gradient or other slightly fancy visual effects
   * Submit FlipClock for bundle


32:16 @jepler
* Last week:
   * Keyboard Guide went live (Commodore 16)
   * Shows some cool techniques including how to ‘await’ a keypad event! Works with any of the 3 kinds of classes in the keypad module, needs 8.0-beta to work
   * Working on PiCow, last milestone: I can wifi.radio.ping() another computer on the internet!
   * Learned that you _CAN_ use emoji in github branch names, but you maybe _SHOULDN’T_
   * Today, playing with checking our type annotations with mypy, draft pull request: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_PIOASM/pull/51 – We’d want to agree on an approach, add it to cookie cutter, and apply it across existing libraries. I’m thinking there might end up being 3 levels: Non, non-strict, and strict. A few libraries might be able to graduate to strict soon, but hopefully we could make them all pass non-strict someday soon.
   * Scanned and posted to archive.org: A cool book from the 80s about floppy disks, half informative and half tongue-in-cheek: https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/09/16/vintage-floppy-booklet-the-secrets-of-perfect-memory/
* This week:
   * Working on PiCow, next visible milestone: resolve a host with socketpool.SocketPool.getaddrinfo(), there are about 3 “invisible” milestones before that
   * Want to publish the 2nd keyboard guide, Tandy 1000, before the end of the month of “Septandy” but PiCow takes precedence.
   * I have a total of 6 different keyboards that I’d love to turn into guides over the next months, all different.
   * Dan, do you want us to meet at some point this week to do a triage of bugs on that 8.0.0 milestone, or the long-open issues?


34:59 @kattni
* Last week:
   * Finally published the WiFi Mailbox Notifier guide!
   * Got my bivalent COVID booster and flu shot Wednesday afternoon
   * Spent Thursday and Friday resting off the side effects
* This week:
   * One last addition to the WiFi Mailbox Notifier - show an external antenna mounted to the mailbox, in case more range is needed or if the mailbox is metal.
   * Post board files for PID 5613
   * QT update to the Quad Alphanumeric backpack guide
   * Guide for LTR329/LTR303
   * Hacktoberfest is coming up soon!


37:15 @Paul Cutler (missing meeting)
* New episode of The CircuitPython Show released today featuring Thea Flowers.
* Released a new trailer for The Bootloader, a new podcast with my co-host Todbot. First episode debuts next week Monday.


37:32 @tammymakesthings (text only)
* Worked on a fix for the problem of circup creating extended attribute files on-device on the current macOS beta. I have a solution to the problem, and need to finish figuring out how to implement a unit test for it before I submit a PR.
* Looking to do some PR reviews this week and have carved out time for that.
* Another super busy week with the day job. There’s a light at the end of the tunnel, but it might just be the headlights of an oncoming train.


38:04 @tekktrik (text only)
* Last week
   * Went through all the library issues and tagged applicable ones as Good First Issue in preparation for Hacktoberfest
   * Patched the aforementioned adabot issue in generating the Library Infrastructure Issues page on circuitpython.org, which helped in finding good issues for Hacktoberfest
   * Submitted PR for Blinka to update __version__ variable upon release
   * Added more cross-linked documentation for the core
   * Started creating a repository for hosting the build and release CIs used by the libraries to use them as a Github action as suggested by @jepler.  This will help avoid adabot patches and associated cleanup everytime we do things like re-pin the version of black.
   * In personal projects, I ordered what I think is the last round of development PCBs for my menorah board project.  I also wrote all the code that runs on a Linode server that helps me test the functionality of the menorah by acting as a fake time service API, and now automatically deploys when I merge pull requests.
* This week
   * Fix the issue with adabot not reporting non-no-milestone issues; nice to think we only have 5 issues, but I’ll look into fixing the bug
   * More preparation for Hacktoberfest and the Community Help Desk that will help prepare people for the event
   * Working on a GitHub Action that can be used to create MPY zip files in releases similar to the way libraries do it now, which I think may be useful for personal projects.  I’ll add that to the circuitpython GitHub org as well.
   * Look into @jepler’s pre-commit mypy suggestion
   * Looking at other additions to my CircuitPython iBeacon library
   * Testing the library CI actions and maybe adding them to the cookiecutter so they can be tested on a new library as it’s being developed
## 40:08 In The Weeds
40:32 @foamyguy 
Trying the mpy filesize actions on this PR as an initial test: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_EMC2101/pull/23


The cookie cutter PR with the changes is here: https://github.com/adafruit/cookiecutter-adafruit-circuitpython/pull/197 


The EMC2101 PR seems like a good candidate for individual testing before committing to the change in cookiecutter and eventually updating existing libraries. 


@tekktrik (text only): Another good one, though not sure how frequently it gets updated, is the Circuitplayground library, just because the size is so tight.  Of the conditions the CI raises on, it might also help create a good baseline.


47:56 @MicroDev (text-only)
This might have been discussed before:- 
Thoughts on making MicroPython Core a submodule and CP not a fork?  
@jepler: that would mean getting down to 0 core changes compared to MP, which is at best extremely difficult
@danh: we have bounced this off of the MicroPython folks, but only aspirationally


54:40 @MicroDev (text-only)
Enable Github Discussion for StackOverflow like QnA, a feature that isn’t available in Discord or Forum?
