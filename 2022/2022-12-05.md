#### 100 CircuitPython Blinka Compatible Single Board Computers!
 100 CircuitPython Blinka Compatible Single Board Computers 

CircuitPython is a programming language designed to simplify experimenting and learning to code on low-cost microcontroller boards.
Blinka brings CircuitPython APIs and, therefore, CircuitPython libraries to single board computers (SBCs). It is a pip installable Python library that runs in normal "desktop" Python (The CircuitPython runtime isn’t used). CircuitPython libraries can also be installed via pip.
Interested? See the guide on how to use Blinka with supported SBCs (like Raspberry Pi, Beagle and more) - Adafruit Blog.
#### 03:37 Project of the Week: A Hanukkah Lightsaber

 Hanukkah Lightsaber 

 Hanukkah Lightsaber 

A Hanukkah Persistence of Light Lightsaber.
* "Toward the Jewish month Kislev, the month of light, I built Hanukkah Lightsaber prop based on a makers project of the Adafruit company. Beside building the hardware, I made the necessary adjustments for the Hanukkah holiday. 30 colored RGB NeoPixel LEDs are connected to Adafruit's Circuit Playground board, responsible for processing a BMP image, divide it into columns, and when deflected the lightsaber and expose to a camera with a slow exposure (today every cell phone have this feature), you get an image floating in space without the person deflecting the Lightsaber. Happy holiday full of light to everyone." - Instagram.
#### 04:25 PicoTouchSynth

"First light on PicoTouchSynth and the capsense pads work better than the PicoTouch board! And the reverse-mount NeoPixel LEDs are totally awesome. The test code is in CircuitPython" Mastodon

## 17:34 Status Updates


18:06 @kattni (hosting)
* Last week:
   * Mastodon API intro guide in moderation.
   * Moderated Liz’s latest guide
   * Updated the Feather RP2040 guide to reflect the latest version
* This week:
   * EYESPI breakout guide with Liz
   * Event Countdown Timer Display


18:54 @CGrover (text only)
* Was heads-down working on a friend’s vintage guitar pedal restoration for the last two weeks. Reverse-engineered the capacitor leakage damaged PCB to help with component location (not to remanufacture the board – yet). Had to treat the pedal with great respect since the bucket brigade chip set components are no longer available. And yes, the project involved CircuitPython for the AD9833 programmable waveform generator used for audio tone and sweep tests. https://github.com/CedarGroveStudios/PCB_Ibanez_FL-9_Flanger
* Developed a proof-of-concept wrapper class (is that a thing?) that wraps a layer around a displayio.Palette object to make it respond to typical list slice syntax. Imagining all sorts of psychedelic image surgery of bitmap images as a result.
* Snow. Shoveling lots of snow.


19:48 @danh
* Following up on and trying to reproduce a number of issues, some not reproducible..
* Reviewed and tested a bunch of PR’s, not all core.
* Oversaw and debugged some HTTPServer issues.
* Trialed a delay for Pico W startup problem – worked; working with Jeff on this.
* Starting on beta.5 release notes.


21:12 @DJDevon3 (missing meeting)
* Received PCB’s of my QT Py Parent BFF. It’s particularly useful for LED projects that need a lot of grounds.Will be used in my Dragon mask to make existing wiring much smaller. I have extra’s if anyone wants one.
*   * Started assembling and packaging kits for TR-Cowbells to give away for beta testing. Found some serious hardware design flaws after more testing. I routed things in a way where all I2C buses are being used. 🙁 Should still function as intended. If people want to add a display or other peripherals they’ll have to use SPI only.
* Started designing TR-Cowbell v1.3 hopefully ensuring I2C expansion and STEMMA will work.
* Made a YouTube video on upgrading the battery in a HyperX Cloud Flight wireless headset from 1500mah to 1800mah. It requires a 3-wire thermistor type battery that I couldn’t find in the US. Had to get it from China, took a month to arrive and the upgrade was a success.




22:18 @foamyguy
   * Last week
   * Finish up PixelMap and displayio API change core PRs 
   * Resolve the reported issues in PixelMap python layer
   * Attempt to update Blinka_DisplayIO API to match changed core, ran into issues with version of python and threading with pygame. Found a resolution eventually
   * This week
   * Take another crack at updating Blinka_DisplayIO API now that my dev environment is back to functional
   * PR Reviews and testing, went over a big typing PR for wiznet library this morning and will test it out with Ethernet Featherwing later today
   * Try to come up with the easiest way to combine MatrixPortal (or other PortalBase) based projects. A few times I’ve seen people asking about or attempting to take 2 or more of the existing learn projects and put them together so that one displays for a while then the other. It may be tricky to come up with a fully general approach, but it’d be nice to have some guidelines and a few examples to point to for people who are “leveling up” to more complex projects on their matrix portal that are combinations of existing ones.
   * PR to add PixelMap to bundle now that its core module is in.
   * Planning and ideas for matrixportal menorah


25:12 @jepler
   * Worked on dotenv replacement. Continuing this week.
   * Other GH pull requests opened:
   * "Add Adafruit ThinkINK RP2040" (draft)
   * "Add SocketPool.gaierror"
   * "Ensure orderly shutdown of ssl socket" (Dan is looking further at root cause)
   * "fix display of the 'host not found' message"
   * "Fix documentation of wifi.Monitor"
   * "handle domain with trailing dot" (on espressif family mcus)
   * "Implement the chain= argument of traceback.print_exception"
   * "Merge weblate manually"
   * "Sdcardio failures"
   * Reviewed & accepted some PRs including "Attempt at pi cow ap" from community member
   * Other work this week is completing the NeXT kbd guide text & photos


27:39 @MakerMelissa
   * Last Week:
   * Worked on rewriting the USB Workflow to use the File System Access API to be able to select a working folder and have a PR in.
   * Fixed an issue with the USB Web Serial connection locking up on disconnect
   * Helped with adding boards to Blinka and circuitpython.org
   * This Week:
   * Working on improving overall connections workflow when there are multiple steps
   * Working on improving BLE Workflow


28:35 @tammymakesthings (missing meeting)
   * Last week: Super busy with work and holidays, but did some work on a digital Christmas ornament (a gift for a co-worker) and on my attempts to add NRPM message support to Adafruit_MIDI
   * This week: Hoping to continue to make progress on these things despite the fact we’re doing performance reviews at work (and I’m missing this weeks’ CircuitPython meeting for a 3 hour performance review “calibration session” ☹️)
   * Other: Had to get new tires on my car because of a huge nail on the freeway, and I was pleasantly surprised when my car stereo noticed the drop in tire pressure and showed me an alert with a screen displaying all four tire pressures from the TPMS sensors. This gave me enough warning to get to a safe place before the tire went flat. I’m curious now to look into how TPMS works, because that was really cool.


29:22 @tannewt
   * Fixed S3 deep sleep
   * Fixed MDNS mangling issue
   * Reworked analogbufio API
   * Started redoing coproc API. Sketched out `memorymap` module and will do coprocessor API too.
   * Trying to do urgent stuff before I leave.
   * Over the weekend:
   * Downloading 700GB of nest video. Wanting to catalog Ari’s movement
   * More backup cataloging work to hash files before squirreled away.
   * Starting to get file metadata from Google Photos to determine which photos I already have locally or *only* have locally.
   * While away:
   * STM32G0 Stemma QT tooling
   * CircuitPython + PyOCD for DIY SWD/JTAG in a pinch.
   * Looking into logic analyzer software story for a basic logic analyzer.
   * Last full week of work at home. Will be around off and on over the holidays.


35:48 @tekktrik (text only)
   * Last week
   * Final touches on the PyPI stats reporting for the libraries and Blinka, all the bugs should be worked out but I’ve said that before ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
   * Worked through many of the issues regarding typing and library infrastructure on my todo list
   * Going through a small backlog I had of PR reviews 
   * This week
   * Getting more information about the pylint update for the Learn guide repository
   * Starting to fix the warnings the GitHub Actions is raising about deprecation
   * In personal news
   * Finished my last lab for my grad course for an embedded systems course - thank you to everyone in this community for helping me to learn enough that programming the Arduino and this course in general has been relatively pain-free
   * Took and passed the Arduino certification test, though I’m still confident in my ability to conjure blue smoke when using one
   * Learning and practicing my C skills by doing the Advent of Code in C this year - it makes me appreciate Python, MicroPython, and CircuitPython so much more!

   * The new Feather RP2040 revision now has a user-controllable button on it (the boot button is now available on GPIO4). Obviously there are far more of the previous revision in the wild than the new version yet. And those original versions will be in the wild for a long time. How do we handle adding `board.BUTTON` to the Feather RP2040 CircuitPython pin definition? 
   * Update cp.org info to differentiate
   * New board def for rev D
   * New PID

   * Soon (but probably not in the next beta) “.env” will be replaced by “settings.toml”. `os.getenv()` will retrieve information from settings.toml, from the top section called the “global table”. We hope the format & name of this file will be better for users than “.env”. Guides & docs will be updated to show how to use the new format, but here’s the idea:
CIRCUITPY_WIFI_SSID="Guest wifi"
CIRCUITPY_WIFI_PASSWORD="unguessable314"
The quoting rules of settings.toml are well defined and are similar (but not quite identical) to Python.

   * We’ll keep doing 8.0.0 betas through the holidays and shoot to release 8.0.0 in January.
