### 3:45 500 Adafruit Projects Have Been Certified as Open Source by OSHWA
Adafruit is an Open Source Hardware and Software company. To that end, Adafruit has been working to submit many of their boards for certification by the Open Source Hardware Association. According to OSHWA:
> The certification program exists to make it easy for creators and users to identify hardware that follows the community definition of open source hardware maintained by OSHWA. Hardware projects that display the certification logo are licensed and documented in a way that makes it easy for users to use and build upon them.
On February 7th, Adafruit hit the milestone of 500 certified projects and was the first to reach this number. By registering their boards with OSHWA, Adafruit aims to ensure users that the products they sell are open-source, and easy to learn about.
Adafruit extends a special thank you to everyone who made this possible, but especially the wonderful folks over at OSHWA who set all this up and were incredibly helpful throughout this process. Additionally, they thank the community that keeps this all going and encourages them to publish, share, and more! - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/02/07/500-adafruit-projects-have-been-certified-as-open-source-by-oshwa/).
### 5:15 CircuitPython 7.2.0 Alpha 2 Released
CircuitPython 7.2.0-alpha.2 was released this week. It is the second published alpha release for CircuitPython 7.2.0. It is relatively stable, but there will be further additions and fixes before final release - [GitHub](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases).
Notable additions to 7.2.0 since 7.1.0
* Continuing work on Raspberry Pi Broadcom board support.
* Espressif ESP32-S3 and ESP32-C3 support, including BLE
* RP2040 PIO sideset support
* `board.STEMMA_I2C()` available on all boards with STEMMA connectors.
* `binascii.crc32()`
* `vectorio.contains()`
### 6:24 Raspberry Pi Beta Tests Network Install of Raspberry Pi OS
Until recently, you’ve always needed to use another computer to run [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/getting-started.html#using-raspberry-pi-imager), or to run something similar, to let you flash your operating system onto an SD card when you get a new Raspberry Pi. But how do you get the operating system onto an SD card if you don’t have another computer in the first place?
There is now a **beta version** of the Raspberry Pi bootloader that implements network installation, and we’d like your help to test it. The new [Network Install](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/getting-started.html#installing-over-the-network-beta) feature can be used to start the Raspberry Pi Imager application directly on a Raspberry Pi 4, or a Raspberry Pi 400, by downloading it from the internet using an Ethernet cable. The Raspberry Pi Imager application, which runs in memory on a Raspberry Pi, can then be used to flash the operating system onto a blank SD Card or USB disk - [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/network-install-beta-test-your-help-required/).
### 7:19 Raspberry Pi OS 32-bit vs. 64-bit Benchmarks
Raspberry Pi OS 32-bit vs. 64-bit Benchmarks have been compiled. Most operations benefit from 64-bit software use. The best speedup is performing the Sysbench CPU test, a 1,380% speedup. Overall using the 64-bit operating system gave a 48% faster response overall - [OpenBenchmarking.org](https://openbenchmarking.org/result/2202058-NE-RASPBERRY79&sgm=1).
### 7:55 The Pi Cast Celebrates 10 Years of Raspberry Pi: New Episodes With Ladyada, Eben Upton, and More
The Pi Cast Celebrates 10 Years of Raspberry Pi: New Episodes With Ladyada, Eben Upton, and others. Adafruit’s Limor Fried will be on a livecast Tuesday February 15, 2022 2:30 PM US Eastern, 7:30 pm UTC – more on [Tom’s Hardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/pi-cast-celebrates-10-years-of-raspberry-pi) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGV6zZmF8Bs).


### 8:30 Sensor Watch on Crowd Supply is CircuitPython Compatible
Sensor Watch is a Microchip SAM L22 based board driving a watch LCD. It's designed to fit into a vintage Casio watch body. It has connections for sensors to make it versatile. And a design goal is ultra-long battery life - months at a time between charges - [Crowdsupply](https://www.crowdsupply.com/oddly-specific-objects/sensor-watch).
A thread where developer Joey Castillo discusses getting CircuitPython working - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/josecastillo/status/1490779372017573893).

## 26:26 Status Updates


27:11 @tannewt (host)
* Last week
   * Wrapping up BLE work for now
      * PR out for GATT client support
      * PR out for packet buffer test examples
      * PR out for BLE BroadcastNet bridge on the S3
   * Started looking into USB host on RP2040. Got example code going
* This week
   * Bring example USB code into TinyUSB’s host stack


28:52 @tammymakesthings
* Last week
   * Submitted 6 PRs to add type annotations to CircuitPython libraries (5 have been accepted/merged, the 6th is still in flight)
   * Submitted a PR to add a command line option to Piku to specify the baud rate for serial connections
   * Started work on a CircuitPython class to represent a deck of cards (shuffling, picking cards, etc). I need this for a project I’m working on, and I’d like to make it so that cards and spreads of cards know how to draw themselves onto a DisplayIO Group.
   * Did a bunch of configuration and setup for my upcoming first electronics making stream on Twitch.
* This week
   * Continue working on my CPY CardDeck class.
   * Finish up the in-flight type annotation PR and hopefully do a few more.
   * Do my first beta test stream on Twitch (planning Monday or Tuesday evening PST) - https://twitch.tv/TammyMakesThings


31:05 @danh
* Release 7.2.0-alpha.2, with about 7 weeks worth of changes.
* Revising some internals of adafruit_requests in preparation for reusing parts of it for async requests, and also to remove some 6.x compatibilities that are no longer needed.
* Created a tentative Adafruit_CircuitPython_Typing, to move types needed for type annotation out of Blinka.
* Fixed a time-jumping bug on SAMD.


33:25 @foamyguy
* Got about half of the Winamp guide completed and got the code much more thoroughly commented / documented
* Tried to start up a project to pull Govt web traffic data but ran into a hurdle because the server only sends GZipped response data. Browsers seem to unzip this automagically so I didn’t realize it wasn’t plain text until trying from a microcontroller.
* Looking into options for inflating the GZipped response data, a few possibilities found, more discussion in the weeds…
* Testing some tweaks inside the cookie-cutter
* Looking into an issue that arose from circuitpython_typing usage within Adafruit-Blinka


34:42 @jepler
* Last week: Floppies!
   * Successfully learned how to use the 2nd core on RP2040 to enable streaming flux data to the computer in realtime
   * Successfully wrote a “.d64” non-copy-protected image to a floppy & booted it on a genuine Commodore SX-64 (the portable version of the Commodore 64, said to be the first color portable computer) Video: https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/02/12/loading-a-commodore-64-floppy-written-with-genuine-greaseweazel-hardware/
   * But there’s one weird MFM-decoding bug that appeared with the new feature, will need to chase it down before the PR can be merged
   * Still waiting for the Adafruit_Floppy repo to settle down before adapting the latest to CircuitPython, so if you want to try the older version you still have to grab it from the Pull Request or build it yourself.
* Last weekend: CircuitPython!
   * Put in a pair of PRs to add support for the “.wrap” and “.wrap_target” directives in PIO programs. This can increase PIO performance in some very specific cases by removing the need for a JMP instruction.  The PRs are in but I haven’t actually tested it on hardware yet so it should be considered experimental. My own use of PIO turns out not to need it as urgently as I thought when I set out to add it, but I finished the PRs anyway “for the sake of completeness”
   * I did close a couple of PRs that weren’t ready and that I had failed for multiple weeks to get back to. I would be happy to see anyone interested in take them up and finish them.
* This week: Merging MicroPython to CircuitPython
   * If this turns out to bring incompatible changes we’ll hold it until 8.0


37:53 @jerryn
* I stumbled across a new (to me) library for using the rfm9x on a Raspberry Pi.
   * https://github.com/epeters13/pyLoraRFM9x
   * It handles interrupts and seems to be working much better with Pi <-> Arduino reliable datagram mode applications. 
   * I’m still testing and exploring some quirks, but it is promising.
   * I was also happy to see that the maintainer accepted a minor PR so it is still being maintained. There had not been much recent activity in the repository
   * Note to anyone using it, the version installed by pip is not the latest. A local install will get the latest version
* I discovered that doing `pip3 install .` in the top level of the repo installs the local version — Who knew?  Someone should write this stuff down ;-)
   *  much better than “python3 setup.py install” which appears to be deprecated or at least discouraged.
* Plan to do more testing this week - also trying to understand the existing issues with changing the rfm9x modem configurations. They make my head hurt…
* Working an a trivial PR to the PN532 library to handle failed ntag2xx reads better.
   * Came from a Discord user question.


41:55 @kattni

47:10 @kmatch
* Last week
   * Updated Focaltouch library for capacitive touchpanel chip FT5x06 that can monitor 10 touch points at a time
   * For monitoring touches I looked at core keypad module, it stores interrupt pin timings in a ring buffer, but not sure how to use this module to trigger an I2C read of x,y data via I2C. Suggestions welcome.
   * Initiated CircuitPython_org library <https://github.com/circuitpython/DisplayIO_ScrollBox> new library with a vertically scrolling Text 
   * ESP32-S3 board: Got to REPL!
* This week
   * Evaluate touch gestures and how to quantify and visualize the raw data to begin categorizing them
      * 1 Point- pan, swipe: Position, Velocity, Acceleration
      * 2 Points- pinch zoom + pan: Centroid position, Distance between, Angle 
      * 3+Points- grab and move: Centroid position, Enclosing diameter
   * Propose update to Cartesian widget for multiple line plotting (for above)


50:00 @makermelissa
* Last Week
   * Finally finished the LittleFS porting project and integrated it into WipperSnapper Firmware Uploader so WipperSnapper can run on the ESP8266
   * Fixed a weird issue with the 2.7” eInk display in Arduino where the colors got inverted if you used the reset pin
   * Fixed an issue with the Raspberry Pi Blinka Installer script when the “python” command didn’t exist
   * Tested a few PRs that were waiting for my review
   * Started adding some new boards to circuitpython.org
* This Week
   * Finish up adding more boards to circuitpython.org
   * Work on catching up with some more GitHub issues
   * Maybe work on some guide updates

* Last week:
   * Updated the native module code from MP to work in CP. Largely untested but will compile and didn’t crash when I ran it.
   * Discussed with @foamyguy the need for a unzip type function that exists in extmod/uzlib
* This week
   * Time is tight but I think putting a decompress module (like MP) in the shared-bindgs/module pattern is doable. This is similar to what was started in PR #1274. First try will be just to get it going, the old PR expanded on it I believe.
   * Fixes to the native module PR and example tests @jepler has. I do not plan to take this code much further at this time but if anyone has questions on it let me know (I could also be convinced to look at it more if there is a lot of interest). The first look was mostly to learn more about that area of the code and to see if I could.
 
52:40 @tekktrik
* Last week
   * Learning the ropes for reviewing!
   * Patched the issues with the split Documentation sections in the READMEs
   * Worked on some follow up PRs for the BLE libraries
   * Fixes for the Blinka circuitpython_typing library
   * Touching up the cookiecutter per @kattni’s recommendations
* This week:
   * Taking some time to work on real life stuff, but hopefully some odds and ends  like bug fixes and library typing when there’s time!
## 53:20 In The Weeds
54:00 @foamyguy - ESP-IDF update in the core? It has been discovered that the webb telescope data API can be successfully fetched using slightly modified sample code from the newest version of the ESP-IDF. The version in use in CircuitPython core currently leads to an SSL Handshake error when trying to fetch the same data. I’m wondering how much would need to go into attempting to update the core to use the latest ESP-IDF and whether there are other potential downsides to trying that.


59:10 @foamyguy - GZip capability for CircuitPython? The data returned by this API comes GZipped: https://analytics.usa.gov/ Browsers seem to be handling this automagically though and the data appears as plain text JSON in the browser. In CircuitPython if we want to be able to consume the data we will need to unzip it. There are a few different ways we could go about it:

* There is an older PR in the core that started to enable this functionality (it exists in micropython is my understanding) We could finish that up and get it in an acceptable state for merging. Then usercode or libraries could use it as needed.
* There is a pure python library implementation Pyflate which has been successfully tested as a proof of concept. The code needed to be updated to py3 but it does seem to work on the microcontrollers. If we go this route with python code it could live inside of it’s own library or move into an existing one like adafruit_requests. 


I’ve noticed that CPython requests library seems to automatically do the unzipping as well. Curious if once we have the ability to unzip would we want to update adafruit_requests to try to handle it automatically to match CPython? Or is it better to keep that library as small as possible and just have user code “manually” handle it as needed?


1:06:51 @MakerMelissa How do the frozen libraries work? It seems some of them are available without the library being installed and some of them are not, for the MatrixPortal for instance.


1:09:23 @jepler Are there some boards where we can consider enabling “native modules”? Rp2040 & espressif “lots of RAM, comparatively” boards seem like good candidates.
## 1:19:22 Wrap-Up
Next meeting is postponed by 1 day in observance of Presidents’ Day in the US. See y’all on TUESDAY February 22 at the usual hour.
