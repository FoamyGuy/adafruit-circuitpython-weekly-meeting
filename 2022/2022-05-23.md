### 02:50 There are now over 300 CircuitPython compatible microcontroller boards
 300 CircuitPython Boards 

There are now over 300 microcontroller boards that support CircuitPython! They include boards from many manufacturers, these are boards from the community, companies that are not Adafruit, and entire new businesses / makers using and shipping boards with CircuitPython. Supported chips include: Espressif, Microchip SAMDs, Nordic, NXP, RP2040s, ST, and more! From Wi-Fi to BLE to LoRA, there is an easy and fun way to program microcontrollers with CircuitPython! - Adafruit Blog.

And check out the article on Tom's Hardware. Tom's will host your editor, Anne Barela on The Pi Cast video on Tuesday May 24th at 2:30pm US Eastern, 19:30 UK BST - Adafruit Blog.
### 03:49 MicroPython Surpasses Original GitHub Sponsorship Target
 MicroPython Surpasses GitHub Sponsorship Target 

MicroPython has been using GitHub Sponsorship to raise funds for development. With over a hundred donors, they fell short of $5,000 a month. Adafruit has already been a sponsor since corporate sponsors were added, and they promoted this worthwhile effort to other MicroPython users. The effort recently surpassed the $5k mark and MicroPython has increased their target to $10,000 per month to hire an additional developer. Are you a user of MicroPython or CircuitPython (a MicroPython derivitive)? Please consider sponsoring some money per month - GitHub.
### 04:25 CircuitPython 7.3.0 Release Candidate Released
 CircuitPython 7.3.0-rc.2 

CircuitPython 7.3.0-rc.2, the third release candidate for CircuitPython 7.3.0 was released. It is considered stable, and is available as a release candidate for testing before the final release of 7.3.0. - Adafruit Blog.

## 17:33 Status Updates


17:56 @kattni (hosting)
* Last week:
   * Published a new page in the Welcome to CircuitPython guide - Library File Types and Frozen Files
   * Added a new section to the Welcome guide CircuitPython Libraries page about The Adafruit Project Bundle
   * Continued testing PyLeap
   * Started PyLeap project guide
* This week:
   * Update Feather V2 guide to instruct installing the WCHx driver
   * QT Py Pico guide
   * PyLeap project guide
   * Create repo for I2C addresses, and work on moving the guide to Markdown files on GitHub
   * Fancy GitHub Profile guide
   * GitHub actions status alert guide


21:28 @danh
* Released 7.3.0-rc.1 with significant bug fixes, and then 7.3.0-rc.2 with f-strings turned on for all builds
* 7.3.0 final release in process
* Saved space on all builds in post 8.0.0-alpha.0 with standard argument validators, and regularizing message text
* Debugging chunked responses to adafruit_esp32spi


23:20 @david.glaude: (lurking)
* Today:
   * Running CP natively on BBQ20KBD ( https://www.solder.party/docs/bbq20kbd/ ) with RP2040 Stamp firmware:
      * REPL is working
      * scanning the internal and external I2C bus is working
* Future:
   * Scan the keyboard
   * PWM the backlight
   * Figuring out the mouse (maybe I2C 0x33 address)


23:48 @foamyguy
* Last week
   * Testing CircuitPlayground library and core frozen library changes to save space in some tight CPX builds
   * Core tweak to display brightness pwm frequency to resolve issue on PyPortal Titano
   * Fix a few instances where typing imports wouldn’t work on python 3.7 properly
* This week
   * Test requests library with node.js server on esp32-s2
   * Look into current capabilities with websockets
   * Fill in high level details about circup on the new libraries learn guide page


25:12 @makermelissa
* Last Week:
   * Finished writing the 2.7” eInk guide which came in handy for a user that needed help over the weekend
   * Went through guide feedback for a number of guides I had made significant contributions to, but were under other author’s names
   * Worked on adding new Feathers and FeatherWings to the guide that provides an overview of everything available
* This Week:
   * Finish updating the Feather and FeatherWings guide
   * Catch up on some GitHub repos I haven’t worked on in a while


25:59 @tammymakesthings
* Thanks to a combination of work stuff and a personal emergency (my air conditioner dying amid 100-degree weather here), I didn’t have time to do any CircuitPython stuff last week. :-(
* This week, hoping to get back to my card deck library, PR reviews,  and once again figuring out a [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/tammymakesthings) streaming schedule I can manage consistently.


26:41 @tannewt
* Last week:
   * Wrapped up NTP changes.
   * `dotenv` PR is out but was having code size issues. Need to check it this week after Dan’s message optimization pass.
   * Started exploring analysis of code size based on elf section dependencies.
   * Started auto-connect to wifi based on env.
* This week:
   * Spend a bit more time with the graph analysis to see if I can find things to optimize. I’m worried about the AI Thinker 2M C3 build because I’ll want to add more to it for web workflow.
   * Experiment with using terminal commands to create a status bar in the terminal. Hopefully a better way of showing workflow status including: wifi status, BLE status, USB status and keyboard.
   * Get `dotenv` PR in and hopefully the auto-wifi one in a PR.


30:38 @tekktrik (text-only)
* Last week
* Added more typing Protocols to circuitpython_typing
* Helped patch a Python 3.7 compatibility issue with type annotations
* Got set up with adabot for running library patches
* Submitted a PR to turn adafruit_logging into a subset of CPython’s logging module
* Started working on getting image transfer setup for the BluefruitConnect library
* This week
* Start rolling out library patches with adabot and the post-patch cleanup
* Continue working on dataclass-like library
* Continue working on getting the BluefruitConnect image transfer working


## 31:19 In The Weeds
31:47 @foamyguy
Any objection to merging https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_CircuitPlayground/pull/117 and/or any other testing that anyone can think of that should get carried out for this change?


Do we anticipate any issues with adabot making library bundles or Learn system project bundling having trouble? 


## 36:10 Wrap-Up
Next meeting is on TUESDAY MAY 31 2022!!!
