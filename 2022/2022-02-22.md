### 256 CircuitPython Boards and More
 256 CircuitPython Boards 

A milestone achieved and passed - 256 boards running CircuitPython. Why celebrate at 256? That's one more than fits in an 8-bit value (0-255) so we're celebrating 0b100000000 boards!
 256 CircuitPython Boards 

Did you know that not all CircuitPython boards are made by Adafruit? Not by a long stretch! SparkFun has fifteen boards, Pimoroni has nine, and so many more. CircuitPython is an open source language which any hardware designer may look to use.
### 3:39 CircuitPython 7.2.0 Release Candidate 0
 CircuitPython 7.2.0 Release Candidate 0 

CircuitPython 7.2.0-rc.0, the initial release candidate for CircuitPython 7.2.0, was posted late last week. It is considered stable, but the CircuitPython team wants to give time for further testing before the final release of 7.2.0 - GitHub.
Notable additions to 7.2.0 since 7.1.1
* Continuing work on Raspberry Pi Broadcom board support.
* Espressif ESP32-S3 and ESP32-C3 support, including BLE.
* RP2040 PIO sideset support.
* board.STEMMA_I2C() available on all boards with STEMMA connectors.
* binascii.crc32().
* vectorio.contains().
* Turkish translation.
### 4:22 Make Your Own Standalone Winamp Skinned Music Player
 Music Player 

Bring back the good ol' days of Llama whippin' fun.
This project will turn your PyPortal into an MP3 player to play your favorite tunes with the familiar Winamp look. Create and manage multiple JSON playlists and rock out to whichever one fits the mood, all done with CircuitPython.
 Winamp Skin Museum 

Take it a step further by choosing a custom Winamp skin (from the Winamp Skin Museum) and convert it for use on your PyPortal - Adafruit Learning System.
### 5:00  WipperSnapper No-Code IoT Platform now works with Adafruit Feather HUZZAH ESP8266
 WipperSnapper 

Adafruit.io WipperSnapper support for the Adafruit Feather Huzzah ESP8266 is here. Over the past few weeks, Melissa worked on a web-based installation tool to upload firmware to an ESP8266 or ESP32. Additionally, this web tool also generates a LittleFS filesystem containing Adafruit IO and WiFi network credentials and uploads them to your ESP32/ESP8266 board - Adafruit Blog.
### 5:33 Project of the Week
 PyPortal Zabbix 

Zabbix is an open-source monitoring software tool to monitor IT infrastructure such as networks, servers, virtual machines (VMs) and cloud services. Zabbix collects and displays monitoring metrics such as CPU, memory, and network load.
Sterling Anderson has developed a stand alone (no computer required) display for Zabbix data. It uses an Adafruit Pyportal programmed in CircuitPython to fetch data via WiFi and display it on a color LCD display. It is housed in a 3D printed case - GitHub.

22:50 @kattni (hosting)
* Last week:
   * Finished up the ADXL375 guide
   * Added offsets functionality to the ADXL34x and ADXL37x libraries.
   * Published the VEML7700 guide update
   * Did a couple of small fixes to the Feather TFT guide
   * Completed the I2C onboard and external CP Essentials pages, and the TFT Basics and TFT WiFi GitHub Stars viewer pages in the Feather TFT guide.
   * Recorded CircuitPython Show podcast
* This week:
   * Finish the rest of the CP Essentials pages in the Feather TFT guide
   * Create new template for using a built in TFT with Arduino, and add to Feather guide, and add a Factory Demo page with a TFT/I2C example in Arduino.
   * Write guide for new MCP23017 I2C GPIO expander breakout with STEMMA QT
   * Create CP Essentials template for asyncio


25:10 @danh
* Fixed some more type annotation issues in various libraries, created a separate circuitpython_typing library, and put a needed change in circup.
* Fixed unneeded waiting for USB when coming out of deep sleep.
* Monitoring asyncio task groups and related additions to CPython (a long time coming!)
* Released 7.2.0-rc.0. 
* This week:
   * Release 7.2.0-rc.1. Maybe release 7.2.0 final.
   * async requests library (as I keep saying).


28:00 @foamyguy (text only)
* Last week
   * PyPortal winamp guide was published and much to my delight featured on Desk of Ladyada. Support for Titano and a few other tweaks in the works this week.
   * Created a few examples for Feather TFT ESP32S2
   * Testing core PRs for zlib module and terminal output preservation
   * Looking into core issues labeled displayio to find ones that I think I have the ability to tackle
* This week
   * Try to figure out where / how to update the certificate(s) that circuitpython uses for making HTTPS requests.
   * Build out the US Govt. web analytics display project. PoC fetching and decompressing data is complete but need to hook up additional APIs for more information and polish visual appearance


28:48 @jepler
* Last week
   * Merged 1.18 into main; up to date with micropython core bugfixes & got some performance improvements. Will be in 7.3.0, not 7.2.
   * Floppy drive: Successfully reading & writing non-copy-protected C64 disks including “flippy” disks after doing a reversible modification to my floppy drive
* This week
   * Preparing for an upcoming presentation for the Dublin Linux Users Group (really this time)
   * Re-doing the wiring on my “flippy mod” (it’s embarrassingly bad right now) & getting guide-quality photos of the process
   * Would like to pick up some bug fixes, will check out the 7.x.x list.
   * Need to do a full tidy & reset of my main work area soon, it’s out of hand
* Coming up…
   * Ordered an Apple IIe from ebay for more floppy fun
   * Preparing a pull request to greaseweazle to add some 8-bit Atari floppy formats; The original 90kB format is working for me, it’s the only disk I have to test.


30:35 @jerryn
* Working on project that grew out of a help request on Discord
   * A user was trying use a gps, bme680 and sdcard on a feather_m0_rfm9x
   * First reaction was – give it up – not enough RAM
   * The user had been trying to use the “del” operator to free RAM - with some success and after a lot of flailing – it actually works well! I now have all it working reliably on the feather m0 rfm9x. The basic idea is to create a function that imports a module, uses it, then uses del to free the RAM used by the module. Using gc after the function call is also necessary.
   * Working on a clear set of examples for how to structure a program for this type of situation.
   * This may be applicable to other M0 boards.




33:25 @kmatch (text only)
* Last week:
   * Both created and fixed a couple of bugs on the “REPL-wrangler” that allows users to move and resize the REPL terminal 
   * Started update to Cartesian graph widget to allow multiple lines and colors
   * Tore down another model of conference room touchscreen display for repurposing/hacking
* This week:
   * Continue Cartesian widget updates (dealing with auto ranging and tick marks)
   * Map out A first draft of how to connect the ESP32-S3 RGB dot clock peripheral to displayio
   * Explore ESP32-S3 LCD peripheral functions in the ESP-IDF


34:05 @mark(gamblor) [lurking]
* Last week:
   * Moved the extmod/uzlib library to CP (PR #6069). Provides decompression utilities for bytes and streams.


34:22 @makermelissa (missing meeting)
* Last Week
   * Froze some libraries into the Portal type boards in CircuitPython
   * Added missing boards to circuitpython.org
   * Added Missing Type Annotations to PlatformDetect
   * Created the ESP32S2TFT Portal style library for the ESP32-S2TFT Feather
* This Week
   * Continue working on some GitHub items as well as minor guide updates


34:51 @tammymakesthings (missing meeting)
* Last Week
   * Completed the PR for the AS7341 library and got that merged
   * At @danh’s request, submitted and completed a PR on the AS7341 library to specify a minimum version of Blinka (6.20.4) in the requirements. This alleviates some of the challenges around type hinting in the libraries
   * Did my first CircuitPython/maker livestream on Twitch <https://twitch.tv/tammymakesthings>
* This Week
   *  Fix my camera and Touch Portal setup for my livestreams
   * Work on more of the type hinting issues in the libraries
   * Get a bit better acquainted with the structure of the core code so I can start finding places to contribute there
