Arduino to support use of MicroPython and Introduces Arduino Lab for MicroPython
 Arduino to support use of MicroPython 

Arduino has partnered with Damien George to use MicroPython on a number of Arduino products. To accompany MicroPython, the new alpha Arduino Lab for MicroPython is available as an alpha release. It is a rebranded fork of work done by Murilo Polese on an IDE which has a similar look to the current Arduino IDE - Arduino Blog and Arduino Labs.
PyScript Updates: Bytecode Alliance, Pyodide, and MicroPython
 PyScript 

Earlier this year, Anaconda unveiled PyScript to enable users to create Python applications in the browser. In order for PyScript to succeed, Anaconda must make strategic investments in both the project itself and its core technology dependencies, such as WebAssembly (Wasm) and the fantastic Pyodide open-source project (PyScript’s primary runtime). To that end, PyScript has been improving its technical foundations over the past few months - anaconda.com.
We are showcasing a technical preview of a new runtime for PyScript based on MicroPython. MicroPython is excellent at running in constrained environments without an operating system and with limited resources. When you apply MicroPython to Wasm in its default configuration, something new and exciting emerges: With a total size of 303KB, this new runtime loads instantly and starts executing MicroPython logic in less than 100ms.
 
While very early in the development process, this runtime will be excellent for creative, educational, and visualization use cases. The MicroPython runtime enables PyScript in many development scenarios where the current runtime loading performance is problematic. Since PyScript supports multiple runtimes via configuration, developers can choose the runtime that best fits the particular problem.

## 18:41 Hug reports
19:15 @jepler (hosting meeting)
* Hug report to LadyAda & PT, welcome to a new adventure. Please carve out the time and space you need for it. (and to editorialize for a second, just speaking for myself – while it’s easy to feel close to those two via time spent on their youtube broadcasts, they deserve privacy about this stuff so just be mindful of boundaries!)

## 30:43 Status Updates


31:15 @jepler
* Last week:
   * Played with LED strips a lot :) while working with a protptype Feather RP2040 Scorpio board

   * opened pull request in adafruit/circuitpython: "Simplify argument checking to reduce translated strings"
   * closed issue in adafruit/circuitpython: "** expression extremely slow compared to math.pow()"
   * opened pull request in adafruit/circuitpython-org: "Designate labels for checkbox in filters"
* This week:
   * Writing a scrolling text example for NeoBFF
   * Doing final checks on 3 prototype boards and, preparing draft board definitions:
      * Esp32-s2 and esp32-s3 reverse tft featherwings
      * Esp32-s2 matrixportal
   * I’m particularly excited about the updated matrixportal, hope it passes muster & becomes a product


36:16 @CGrover (text only)
* After revisiting and refactoring the Thermal Camera code, I began to notice opportunities to apply ulab to improve time-critical routines in other projects. This led to the discovery that displayio.Group and displayio.Palette objects don’t support slice objects even though they act as lists. Going to test and contemplate this a bit more before submitting an issue. This could be a game-changer for quickly changing properties such as position and color for a subset of group objects such as game sprites or thermal camera grid displays.
* Developing a generic “failover” library for Portal devices to place a screen or matrix display into a low-power mode instead of a bright REPL screen when encountering a “fatal” error, all in an effort to reduce display-generated heat. It’s especially critical for unattended TFTs in tight enclosures or in general for RGB-LED matrix displays.


37:39 @danh
* Lotsa reviews.
* Met with Scott last week to catch up.
* Fixed an STM PWMOut bug, which was an off-by-one issue about timer numbering. STM timers start numbering at 1, for some reason.
* Fixed an RP2040 PinAlarm race condition. If an alarm pin was triggered after setup but before sleep, it would not wake up the board during sleep.
* macOS Ventura BOOT drive copying issue is worse for nRF52 bootloader; the bootloader stops working almost immediately and you can’t copy anything.. Documented this in our blog post.
* Continuing to fix other 8.0.0 bugs.


40:41 @DJDevon3 (text only)
* Finished up PR changes in my adafruit_requests API examples. FoamyGuy streamed while reviewing my PR and I learned some new things. Using string replace instead of regex means 1 less library. It was a great experience having my PR reviewed during a live stream, can highly recommend it. I learned a lot!
* FoamyGuy seemed interested in having a Twitch API example so as a thank you for helping me through the PR I dove into that last night. Running into 0Auth issues, hoping to have it working and a PR submitted for it later this week.
* Made a good amount of progress on my TR-Cowbell sequencer thanks to Neradoc. He completely rewrote the code… and he added asyncIO… and he did it blind without having my board in his hands. He’s getting proper credit for his contribution in the github project page. After looking at the code he wrote, I would have never gotten it, I wasn’t even close. Bravo Neradoc and thank you.
* Went through the eye of Hurricane Nicole. It was inconsequential as I was on the weak side of the eye wall, didn’t even lose power. Hope Anne Barella & Ruiz Brothers made it through unscathed.
* Due to the hurricane I picked up a battery powered Weller soldering iron. Shot a YT video review on it that shows me almost setting a surge protector on fire. There was smoke and I wasn’t kind about the design flaw of an untethered soldering iron being able to roll around.
* Was inspired by Sophy Wong’s designs after watching her talk at Hackaday SuperCon on YouTube. Ended up making Cyber Ski Goggles. The silicon jackets on Noods do not stick to hot glue, it’s like trying to glue teflon so you have to go over the filament and tack it down. Results would be cleaner with a custom 3D printed housing. You can run noods without a resistor and they’re much brighter as you can see in the image. The red noods have a 68 ohm resistor which is just enough to have a visible difference.It’s running pulsing animation so I’m not worried about them burning out.

   * Investigating Mastodon (@NOeVoting@hostux.social) and trying to figure out where to do my microblogging, build an alternate network and recover/convert my Twitter archive.
   * Making the “sensor-less” Xiao NRF board easier to find (same UF2 as Xiao NRF SENSE) on CircuitPython.org
   * Building two Adafruit.IO temperature sensors (MCP9808), one with a PyPortal and one with Pico W to monitor internal and external temperature of an extension of my home: https://hostux.social/web/@NOeVoting/109337020001926977
   * Failure to make it work with WipperSnapper (also not available on PicoW?) so I used CP
   * Trying to figure out the quality of the isolation and the thermal behavior with various heater settings.
   * Investigating how to use my new radar (24GHz mmWave Sensor - Human Stationary Presence), it has a UART protocol with checksum and the only driver is in C for Arduino… so I guess I have to do it myself.


43:52 @foamyguy
   * Test and reviewed API examples for requests library
   * Implemented the hidden property for vectorio shapes so they can be made invisible directly, without needing a parent Group
   * Tested out an improvement in led_animation helper classes
   * Looked over and tried out the core implementation of PixelMap that Jeff submitted a PR for. Very insightful to see the different bits of code involved in implementing a new class in the core.
   * Getting cp.org build tools and testing environment working


45:27 @kattni
   * Last week:
   * Put PiCowbell Proto guide in moderation on Friday
   * Workshopped adding a few things to the Adafruit Community Code of Conduct, and updating some formatting and non-functional bits.
   * This week:
   * Meeting with Liz about some questions she has about hosting this meeting, and about when we want to do a couple of guides we’re both working on
   * Continue on ACCoC updates, specifically adding a document covering the update process.
   * Next product guide is Quiik STEMMA hub breakout
   * Decide what’s next.
   * My list is massive so I will not run out of things to do.
   * Out a little early tomorrow.
   * This past weekend:
   * “Finalised” the code for a personal project (which is to say, it will almost certainly be updated right quick). It parses an RSS feed, takes a few pieces of data, generates a dynamic string, and sends the string to Twitter and Mastodon.
   * Includes customisations such as disabling Twitter, Mastodon or both. It now has error checking for authorisation. It also now includes checking to ensure it does not post duplicate messages if the script is run and no data has been added to the RSS feed.

50:01 @makermelissa
   * Last Week:
   * Cleared out remaining PlatformDetect PRs that were in limbo
   * Fixed an issue with the WebSerial ESPTool trying to deploy twice and overwriting files
   * Reviewed lots of circuitpython.org PRs.
   * Fixed the Adafruit_Python_Shell library’s run_command() function so it’s not locking up occasionally
   * Merged in some waiting Raspberry Pi Installer Script PRs
   * Started working on converting Raspberry Pi Installer Scripts once again from Shell to Python.
   * Updated learn guides that were still using some of the old scripts
   * Request for a review of https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython-org/pull/1086 and https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython-org/pull/1088 which have been waiting for almost a couple of weeks.
   * This Week:
   * More Shell script conversions
   * Meet with Scott to talk about working on code.circuitpython.org
   * Probably move over to corking on code.circuitpython.org some more


51:18 @mark[gamblor21] (text only/away)
   * Reassembled my giant 300 neopixel display
   * Looking at NeoPxl8 for num_strands < 8. Needs some tweaks with how the data is passed to the PIO program.
   * Had a random thought about making a NeoPixelFramebuffer core module (like RGBMatrix and IS31FL3741 framebuffers). If anyone has thoughts on this, good or bad, please let me know.


51:53 @Paul Cutler
   * New episode of The CircuitPython Show out today with guest Joey Castillo.  We chat about I2C and the LCD Featherwing, the Open Book, and low power and deep sleep with CircuitPython.
   * Wrote a Python app to create transcriptions and subtitles that I can use with the podcasts


52:19 @tammymakesthings (text-only)
   * Been super slammed with work stuff for the past couple of weeks (kicking off a big new project) so haven’t had time to do a lot and have been absent from the past couple of meetings.
   * This week: 
   * Looking at what’s required to add support for NRPN messages to Adafruit_MIDI
   * Looking at whether I can implement the Mastodon API on CircuitPython enough to make a Mastodon scrolling “latest toot” board.


52:56 @tannewt
   * Back from 12 weeks of paternity/bonding leave. Ari can now crawl, has ~4 teeth and can pick up and eat food. He loves to stand on his feet (with help) and grab everything and anything to put in his mouth.
   * Did have some “hobby” projects during leave:
   * Got CP running on the Bangle.js 2 and have been using it as my regular watch. It shows the time and the most important notification.
   * Spent time analyzing seattle city council redistricting alternatives. (CW language: https://www.thestranger.com/news/2022/10/04/78569133/magnolias-unwitting-hero )
   * Spent some time playing with FPGAs. The OrangeCrab is a very cool board to start with. Also interested in RISC-V cores. Got distracted from that to add RISC-V support to pyOCD. LukeW was helpful with their Hazard3 core. Would also apply to ESP32-C3.
   * Spend a little time thinking about logic analyzer future for TinyLogicFriend. The sigrok project isn’t in a good state. 50+ open PRs on two main repos.
   * Interested in a project to control a baby monitor from CircuitPython. Got distracted by the desire to have a programmable StemmaQT core. The STM32G0 is a cheap Cortex M0+ and the STM bootrom has an I2C loader. I ordered assembled boards from JLCPCB that should arrive on Thursday. Slightly distracted by adding SVD loading into the PyCortexMDebug gdb plugging from cmsis-pack-manager that is used by PyOCD. https://github.com/tannewt/StemmaG0
   * Goal this week is to get caught up on communications (Discord, forum and e-mail.) and then have an idea of priorities.
   * Will definitely do Bangle.js 2 stuff.
   * Probably want to finish USB host support if someone hasn’t beat me to it.
   * Also need to figure out where 8.0.0 is and help get it stable.


1:04:32 @tekktrik (text only)
   * Last week:
   * Finished patching all the issues resulting from the CI upgrade to allow the use of Python 3.11
   * Started work on a command line tool called circfirm that will make installing versions of the CircuitPython UF2 very simple - I’m hoping it will be a compliment to circup
   * Played bug whack-a-mole with adabot as various checks have been updated and the PyPI stats addition continues to evolve
   * Reviewed PRs now that the CI is sorted out for them
   * This week:
   * Continuing to watch for issues resulting from updates made to libraries to fix pylint issues - I don’t foresee any issues, but please let me know if something doesn’t seem like it’s working.
   * Continuing to work on circfirm and begin writing documentation and instructions
   * Taking some personal time for family wedding this weekend, so it may be a light week.
## 1:05:35 In The Weeds
   * 1:05:55 @deshipu A lot of people are confused about how displayio works by adding the elements you need to groups and then changing them, instead of re-drawing everything each time. I think part of this might be the display.show() function. Now that we have display.root_group, how about replacing display.show() with an assignment to display.root_group? I think it would make it a little more transparent about how it works.
   * 1:10:04 @moto-timo wants to invite folks to Yocto Project Summit 2011.11 (Nov 29 – Dec 1, 2022) and FOSDEM (Feb 4-5, 2023)/Openembedded Workshop (Feb 6, 2023) (CFP to be public soon).
