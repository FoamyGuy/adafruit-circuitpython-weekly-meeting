## 21:14 Status Updates
21:45 @foamyguy
* Last week
   * Pare down the embedded web workflow edit page to the basic one with external dependencies
   * Official kickoff post and video for the Hack Tablet give away. First few winners will be selected this week
   * Octopus Game high score functionality and more guide pages
* This week
   * Start Hack Tablet library
   * Try to finish up the Octopus Game guide
   * Short vacation for upcoming weekend. No Deep Dive stream on Friday 8/5 


23:37 @CGrover (text only today)
* Commenced work on the ClueCoffeeScale (NAU7802 ADC) learn guide.
* Wrapping up four project enclosures this week (sawing, routing, thread tapping, painting). Fingers are hoping for a less-than-three BandAid experience.
* Going back into the studio to track some new songs next week.


24:09 @danh
* updated macoOS choice for mpy-cross build
* more ESP32SPI debugging
* debugging ESP32 builds with PSRAM disabled; it does a boot loop when disabling the SPI flash cache, but only when both cores are in use


25:58 @deshipu
* progress with robots: gait, faces, openmv
* stage now supports png instead of gif
* preliminary support for png in adafruit_imageload, need to add filters
* need to learn how to start a library


28:46 @jepler
* Last week & This Week: ESP32 camera stuff based on https://github.com/espressif/esp32-camera
* Status: As of this morning, one camera module works on ESP32-S2, can take RGB565 and JPEG images.
* Needs to cooperate better with CircuitPython (big item right now is allocating a PWM instance)
* Needs to have an OO API, free choice of pins (vs hard coded) etc
* Needs to have settable camera properties similar to the existing libraries for the OVxxxx cameras (though code compatibility is NOT a goal)
* Some parts may be upstreamable to Espressif
* Need to schedule a video call with Dan and Kattni to discuss our CircuitPython Day stream


30:30 @kattni
* Last week:
   * Finished up my list of WipperSnapper guide updates
   * Created a Power Management template for Feather guides, filled out one, and handed the rest of the guide updates over to Eva
   * Verified all of the templates before they were deployed
   * Misc
   * Set up some new libraries on RTD
* Last Saturday:
   * My PyOhio talk went live on Saturday morning. Now available on YouTube.
* This week:
   * PCF9574 product guide
   * Verify the current list of new Power Management templates that Eva finished since I last checked so she can deploy them
   * Set up new libraries on RTD
   * Short week again.
* Basement:
   * Patched drywall mudding where needed
   * Sanded all of it
   * Found one more patch needed
   * Redid a section of plumbing where the well line enters the basement with PEX, and installed a new iron filter
   * Started priming, 1 coat
   * Found out how much junk was in the water previously when we had to clean the aerators on all of the faucets. The basement faucet had one built in that had clearly never been touched. It was….. nasty.
   * Next up:
      * Sand the final patch
      * Prime the rest of it x2 coats
      * Clean as much as possible
      * Then it’s ready for the rest of August.
      * Will be continuing in September.


32:03 @kmatch
* Last week: spent a few days visiting family
* This week: Evaluate techniques to analyze a single pulse and separate it from background noise for an Infrared Time of Flight sensor


32:29 @tammymakesthings
* Last week: Debugging my Matrix Portal CI/CD status board project
* This week: Hopefully finishing up the Matrix Portal CI/CD status board, hopefully doing some PR reviews, thinking about/planning a CircuitPython Day activity.


33:05 @tannewt
* Made improvements to C3 serial. No longer drops echoed characters. Also enters REPL quickly. Turning on wifi leaves USB active.
* Fixed websocket handling of frames of 125+ bytes.
* Merged in web workflow responsiveness fix and changes to title bar to limit how often it is sent.
* Merged in changing web workflow port and dynamic reload of settings.
* Working to enable web workflow on ESP32 and adding a couple more boards.
* This week, fixing more bugs including title bar non-update.
* Working with Antonio on File Glider web support.
* Working with Melissa on code.cp.org web support.


35:06 @tekktrik (not present)
* Last week
   * Final touchups and test run of the pyproject.toml generation and switchover scripts, everything looks ready to go for next week!
   * Added AGS02MA gas sensor to the Adafruit bundle
   * Touched up the SI1145 library, as well as submitted PR for additional functionality
* This week
   * On vacation all over the Northeast US so will resume next week!
## 35:56  In The Weeds
@DJDevon3 (text only)
* Custom USON8 to SOIC8 PCB’s (USONuvaChip) arrived which is a 15mm adapter board for the Bluefruit Sense. To use this board I need to add a PR for the bluefruit sense to allow a 16MB Cypress flash chip in ports/boards and nvm.toml. This tiny 15mm adapter pcb allows a 2MB Bluefruit Sense to have 16MB of flash. Will be my first build contribution, baby steps.


@tekktrik (not present)
* The design guide recommends using adafruit_bus_device where possible, but what about adafruit_register?  May make it harder for smaller boards to use, but handles the abstraction of bit shifting and whatnot for code safety.  How should relatively simple sensor libraries approach using (or not using) adafruit_register? 
   * Context seems to be https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_SI1145/pull/4 – jepler
   * Design Guide: https://docs.circuitpython.org/en/latest/docs/design_guide.html#use-busdevice - carter


58:47 @kattni
* CircuitPython Day! Email your ideas, projects, suggestions, etc to circuitpythonday@adafruit.com - This is the best way for me to keep track of things. Thanks!
