* @dsohrabian for continued testing of MatrixPortal network issues


@CGrover 13:50  (text only)
* @Foamyguy for taking the Titano backlight issue and running it towards the finish line with changes to the CircuitPython core. Also appreciate Foamy’s comments on the touchscreen calibrator example PR.


@foamyguy 14:18 (not attending today)
* @CGrover for submitting touchscreen calibration example PRs
* @Jerryn for everything they contributed. Especially around radio modules. Testing some of the older PRs in those libraries was my introduction to RF and Jerry was very helpful
* Group Hug


@jepler 14:46
* Group hug


@kattni 14:52
* @tekktrik for finding an issue with the libraries over the weekend, and immediately fixing it.
* @jerryn for helping me out with a project that I got the pieces for ages ago, and of course left to the last minute to finish.
* @blitzcityDIY for doing all the code/firmware testing for the QT Py guide.


@makermelissa 16:02
* @kattni for helping with updating Fritzing
* @prcutler for contributing to the OpenSign project
* @anneb for your great interview on Tom’s Hardware
* Group Hug


@mark(gamblor) (not attending / no voice) 16:21
* Group hug


@tammymakesthings (not attending) 16:33
* Group hug


@tannewt 16:40
* Everyone in our community. You are a pleasure to interact with.


@tekktrik (text-only or not present) 17:15
* @kattni for the quick help getting an Adabot patch going to support the Sphinx 5.0.0 upgrade
* @danh for helping to get the manual fixes for other issues regarding the Sphinx update reviewed and merged
* Group hug!
## 17:45 Status Updates


@danh (hosting)
* Released CircuitPython 7.3.0 final.
* Fixed problem with multiple rotary encoders on Espressif. Fix will be in 7.3.1.
* Fixed buffer/buffer-size issue with ESP32SPI library; review in progress. Also have a general cleanup PR for the library.
* Debugging other network problems.


@CGrover (19:20 text only)
* Wrapped up the touchscreen calibration example PR for built-in displays supported by adafruit_touchscreen.
* The CedarGrove_NAU7802 CircuitPython library was placed into the community bundle for use with the new NAU7802 breakout and a couple of custom FeatherWing boards. Was an interesting and complicated learning experience (adventure).
* Developed a prototype gamma-sensitive brightness control helper for the Matrix Portal that currently works with displayio object color and fill attributes as well as bitmap palettes. A bonus is that the algorithm works nicely with NeoPixels and other RGB LEDs. Now I’m on a steep learning curve trying to figure out how to walk a multi-layer displayio.group tree to 1) capture initial full-brightness color information and 2) modify displayio object colors based on the prototype’s gamma-sensitive color brightness algorithm. The goal is to create a helper or class that can linearly adjust display brightness similar to a TFT backlight. Lower brightness means less heat, lower power consumption, and a display that’s easier to photograph.


@kattni 20:40
* Last week:
   * Started the QT Py ESP32 Pico guide
   * Worked with Liz for testing code and firmware for the QT Py Pico guide
   * Updated Feather ESP32 V2 guide with new drivers
* This week:
   * Finish QT Py ESP32 Pico guide - on hold until I have hardware
   * WipperSnapper CircuitPython board GIF series
   * GitHub fancy profile guide
   * Light tower GitHub Actions status light
   * Add a project to PyLeap guide
   * Set up repo for I2C Address guide migration to Markdown.


@makermelissa 22:40
* Last Week:
   * Finished updating Feathers and FeatherWings guide
   * Deprecated old general eInk guide in favor of the 4 separate guides I wrote
   * Added a bunch of new checks to the circuitpython.org repo and fixed any issues found with those checks.
   * Worked on some miscellaneous GitHub issues
   * Went through Guide Feedback for NeoPixels on Raspberry Pi guide
* This Week:
   * Work on some more GitHub issues
   * Possibly circling back to working on Touchscreens on the Raspberry Pi
   * Not sure what else yet


@mark(gamblor) 23:22 (not attending / no voice)
* Did a small PR to add setting static IPs for wifi that was asked for in an enhancement issue.


@tammymakesthings 23:43 (not attending)
* Didn’t work on CircuitPython stuff last week :-( 
* This week: Aiming to get back into my regular groove


@tannewt 23:52
* Wrapped up dotenv commit.
* Created treemap.dev to view treemaps. Finding what takes up firmware space.
* https://github.com/tannewt/treemap.dev and https://github.com/adafruit/elf-section-graph
* Working on PR to save space by putting translate() in header for non-LTO builds. Allows the compile stage to optimize things away.
* Tried doing clang 13 but still too large. Can’t do -Os or -Oz LTO. https://github.com/tannewt/circuitpython/tree/clang13
* Started prototyping new serial output.
* Next is more wifi workflow work.


@tekktrik  28:00 (text-only or not present)
* Last week:
   * Developing more tools to check the libraries for build issues and patch Library Bundle problems (a very accidental yet timely happenstance)
   * Writing documentation for said tools so others can eventually use them
   * Helped get the majority of libraries fixed for the new Sphinx v5.0.0 via adabot
   * Started playing bug whack-a-mole for a few libraries with additional Sphinx issues due to deprecations and new features in Sphinx v5.0.0
* This week:
   * Continue developing patch tools
   * Wrap up manual patch fixes for Sphinx upgrade
   * Start manual patches for the previous .pylintrc adabot patch
   * Taking time to hang out with my girlfriend’s family
