## 03:20 Community News
### 03:21 Mainline Python 3.14 Predicted to be Faster than C++
  

In about a month, there will be a new yearly release of Python: version 3.11. The main feature for this version is a significant increase in speed. People are testing the new version and their results are stunning. Extrapolating keeping at this pace, Python 3.14 will be faster than C++. To be exact, the loop time will be -0.232 seconds, so it will be done just before you want to do the calculation - https://towardsdatascience.com/python-3-14-will-be-faster-than-c-a97edd01d65d
### 04:13 Adafruit Pinguin - use any Font in EagleCAD
  

Autodesk’s EAGLE — the PCB design software favored around Adafruit — has a problem: the circuit boards it produces, while perfectly functional, are ugly, with vintage plotter-like text and no font support. Pinguin is a Python script that substitutes TrueType fonts for EAGLE’s ugly plotter-stroke text. Open Source software - https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-pinguin-for-eagle-cad?view=all


### 04:58 Tandy TRS-80 Model 100 Retro-refit
  
  

Retrofitting a vintage Tandy TRS-80 Model 100 portable with Raspberry Pi hardware. The first step is to utilize the keyboard. A Raspberry Pi Pico, running CircuitPython, decodes the keyboard matrix. Next up us using a Raspberry Pi computer and modern color display - https://github.com/GrantMeStrength/retro/blob/gh-pages/TandyM100/index.md

## 15:59 Hug reports


16:24 @foamyguy (host)
* @CGrover for making and sharing a Palette Filter library that makes it easier to manage transparency color indexes inside of displayio.Palette objects.
* @tcfranks for submitting many typing PRs and other improvements across library repos.


17:02 @CGrover (text only)
* @tekktrik for the speedy review and merge of a Community Bundle submittal.
* @foamyguy for testing the PaletteFilter library.
* @PaulCutler and @todbot for the first in (hopefully) a long series of The Bootloader podcasts. Walked away from today’s with a couple of cool nuggets.


17:28 @danh
* @snkYmkrct for their first two PR’s, adding filename support for WaveFile and MP3Decoder
* @jepler for taking a break from PicoW to fix some 8.0.0 bugs
* @kattni and @jepler for bug and PR triage meeting
* @jepler for making great progress on PicoW implementation
* @microDev for a bunch of PR’s, reviews, and other contributions


18:23 @david.glaude (not speaking)
* @todbot and @PaulCutler for the new Bootloader podcast
* @jepler for the progress on PicoW
* @anecdata for the http server example

* @PhilB for making it possible to use Papyrus font on PCB made with Eagle


19:09 @DJDevon3 (not present)
* Hug to FoamyGuy for hosting the meeting
* To CGrover & FoamyGuy for advancing Circuit Python graphical capabilities. It’s been a lot of fun seeing all sorts of new possibilities take shape.
* To Todbot and PRCutler for hosting their first episode of the Bootloader. They shared some interesting stuff I had no idea about.
* To Lady Ada for designing a really neat step switch breakout. The footprint alone should help synthaholics with their PCB designs.
* To Jepler for launching the Pico W demo during show & tell. Really exciting development!
* To Neradoc & Todbot for helping with some code that got my step sequencer working. Python zip isn’t for zipping files. The zip class is exactly what I was looking for. :)


20:07 @jepler
* Pico-sdk and micropython authors for all the ground work on pico wireless networking that I built on
* Thanks to all who are thanking me & otherwise giving recognition for the pico w work, even if it makes me blush
* Community members including Anecdata & bill88t for feedback on the in-progress PR
* Tekktrik for fixing the milestone reporting in state of circuitpython, even if you broke it in the first place


21:10 @kattni
* @argonblue (from Discord) for helping out in so many places on Discord. They recently became a Community Helper, and they are filling that out in so many ways, I continue to be impressed.
* @Neradoc for helping me out with some questions that potentially eliminated me needing to do a PR
* @tammymakesthings for always being available for a chat, whether needed or simply wanted.
* Group hug!


22:48 @makermelissa

23:27 @tammymakesthings 
* Group hug to the community for being awesome!


23:39 @tekktrik
* @foamyguy and @kattni for helping me navigate issues as a reviewer, this community has been so awesome in terms of providing support to people across all parts of the contribution process.
* @Neradoc for teaching me that the RP2040 can use Blinka, and preventing me from giving wrong advice to someone on GitHub
* @tcfranks for keeping up with the type annotation PRs, it’s awesome to see the number dwindle down
* Group hug!
## 24:46 Status Updates


25:16 @foamyguy (host)
* Implemented an option for horizontal line in the Flip Clock sprite generator
* Resolved the remaining pylint / pre-commit issues to prepare library for bundle
* Tested and showed CGrover’s Palette Filter on Deep Dive
* Update mpy filesize action task to compare with main branch instead of released / bundle mpy file and added a summary section with the high level comparisons and difference of sizes.


26:32 @CGrover (text only) 
* Shifting back to the Eurorack RangeSlicer module refactoring. Converting it to a state-driven approach. Will also investigate asyncio and its impact on time-critical events.
* Submitted a PaletteFilter library to the Community Bundle. Its primary purpose is to convert a range of color values (based on a visible spectrum algorithm) to a replacement color value or transparency.
* Planning to develop additional displayio.Palette tools, perhaps a palette optimizer to reduce palette size by culling unused and duplicate palette index entries. Stuff like that. (The line is beginning to blur between bitmaptools and palette tools.) 
* Fall yard work continues. Removing more lawn, pouring concrete, and moving a ridiculously large pile of decorative rock. The goal is to reduce water consumption and waste by another 50%.


27:39 @danh
* Off for several days last week. Reviewed a bunch of PR’s on return.
* Will be testing power consumption during deep sleep to make sure we are doing what we can to minimize current during sleep.
* Probably should make an 8.0.0-beta.1 soon just to catch up on a bunch of changes.


28:56 @david.glaude (not speaking)
* Finishing the “External Display” PRs for CircuitPython.org (based on the result of “vote” of last week).
* Long exchange with @ATmakers to replicate his USB filter:
   * Trinket doing USB Host in Arduino ⇔ UART ⇔ CP board (QTPy RP2040)
   * Installing Eagle and Arduino 2.0 to be ready to adapt/replicate
* Documenting in gist some of my research notes (before closing all the tabs):
   * USBHost in CP and alternative: https://gist.github.com/dglaude/e779f4cf3635bd78b08bdeecb8807453
   * ps2io support in CP notes: https://gist.github.com/dglaude/67585e5be7f59e0f080afbe1f8a25ba9
   * ps2dev how to pretend to be a ps2 keyboard with Arduino: https://gist.github.com/dglaude/2c139044f6462f0eb448e129024d0c1c


30:09 @DJDevon3 (not present)
* LORA messenger still on the back shelf. No progress.
* Designed a new v1.2 of my step sequencer called the TR-Cowbell. It now has a Stemma connector, stemma breakout, 9 GPIO breakout, running on the Pi Pico. Learned how to use a font as a solder mask layer so the font is exposed copper. Got a hardware test functioning thanks to Todbot giving me a hint to use the zip class. Watching all the little lights sequentially running made me giddy and do a happy dance. Papyrus font on the back. ;) Tested and runs CP beautifully. Pretty sure I ironed out all the major hardware bugs and ordered 20 PCB’s. They should arrive in about 2 weeks.  
  

   * Hurricane Ian on its way to Florida and looks like I might get hit along with millions of other Floridians. I’m on the east coast, less of a worry but still might lose power and be out of commission for an unspecified amount of time as I deal with the cleanup. Pretty sure the Ruiz brothers are in the same boat. Hunker down and stay safe.


31:51 @jepler
   * Last week:
   * Published draft PR for pico w wifi support – no ssl/https yet, and needs stability improvements. Please test and report your results. Take the uf2 from https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/6933 and comment at https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/6558
   * Made PRs for several issues blocking the 8.0.0 release
   * Completed the code & text for my next guide, a Tandy 1000 keyboard to USB converter using CircuitPython & QT Py RP2040
   * Investigated using Python to preprocess static typing “cruft” out of libraries before mpy-compiling. Contributed bug fixes to “astmonkey”, a library for manipulating Python code using Abstract Syntax Trees
   * This week:
   * Finish and publish the guide
   * Test, reproduce, and fix reported SDIO problem on Grand Central M4
   * Return to Pico W work
   * Bug fixes
   * Once that’s merged, investigate the feasibility of ssl/https support
   * Future:
   * The next keyboard on deck is a NeXT non-ADB keyboard previously done nearly a decade ago as an Arduino guide by LadyAda herself: https://learn.adafruit.com/usb-next-keyboard-with-arduino-micro/overview


35:38 @kattni
   * Last week:
   * Tested the MCP9600 frequency options due to a vague comment in the simpletest. Ended up removing comment altogether, and adding warning in the guide about Pi clock stretching, with a link to our Pi Clock Stretching guide page. Also realized the docs and guide explanation for the `delta_temperature` were atrocious (yes I wrote both), and so I updated both to be significantly more informative and clear.
   * Was supposed to do the STEMMA QT revision of the quad alphanumeric backpack next, but needed verification on where that update was supposed to go.
   * So instead I started on the LTR-329 and LTR-303 breakouts guide. Same chip, 303 has an int pin. Got through a couple of pages there.
   * LTR-329 was delivered, but the 303 was not yet in stock.
   * Found out where to put the QT revision update.
   * Started on the QT revision alphanum backpack guide update. About ⅔ of the way through.
   * This week:
   * QT backpack revision needs updated wiring diagrams, and the applicable pages updated with those diagrams. 
   * Test issue #6676 on CircuitPython. Close if resolved.
   * Pick back up with the LTR-3x guide. LTR-303 breakouts are on my porch.
   * Add Metro Mini V2 to the Metro Mini guide
   * Next quest is a mystery!


39:12 @makermelissa
   * Last week:
   * Fixed BLE connectivity issues in Code Editor
   * Started working on the USB Workflow, though it’s proving to be more troublesome than I thought it would be
   * Helped Brent troubleshoot why the WipperSnapper LittleFS partition was no longer working
   * This week:
   * Working on trying to wrap up USB workflow. It’s pretty close now.
   * Currently stuck on finding a reliable way to detect if the user hits cancel on the file dialog
   * Fix BLE upload issues
   * Get all the recent changes bundled up and made live
   * Other:
   * Finally finished a huge sorting project with all of my electronics and 3D printing stuff
   * Working on moving it all out of my office by the end of this week.


40:16 @Paul Cutler
   * Last week:
   * Recorded an episode of The CircuitPython Show with Jim Mussared from MicroPython.
   * This week:
   * The first episode of The Bootloader with todbot is out today.  
   * Taking The CircuitPython Show on the road for the first time!  I’ll be traveling to Wisconsin for a special Halloween episode.
   * Community Help Desk this Thursday
   * Next week:
   * Missing the meeting next week for very minor hand surgery.


40:59 @tammymakesthings
   * Last week: Ridiculous week at my day job (32 meetings!), but worked a bit on issue with circup and extended attribute files on the macOS Ventura beta. I think some of the issue I’m seeing is related to the fact that macOS has an `xattr` command, but the `xattr` python module installs its own command with different semantics. Need to test whether getting the `xattr` module’s version of the command out of my search path helps the issue.
   * This week: More meetings at work, but carving out some time for PR reviews and figuring out the circup issue. Also might have a bead on the macOS Ventura issue which broke my OBS and is currently preventing me from streaming.


42:27 @tekktrik
   * Last week
   * Set up OBS and prepared for the Community Help Desk stream this Thursday
   * Fixed an issue (caused by me) where adabot wasn’t reporting open issues for all milestones
   * Finalized and added my first library to the Adafruit CircuitPython Bundle - BLE Beacon, a library for working with Bluetooth beacons.  Currently it allows for use with iBeacons.
   * Added the ability for Blinka to update the __version__ attribute before uploading to PyPI
   * Additionally, Blinka now builds and uploads a pure Python wheel which should cut down a little on both the install and setup time when pip installing.
   * Continued working on the GitHub Action for creating MPY files for releases, for use in personal projects
   * In personal projects, I wrote some of my first real Bash scripts for uploading firmware and software to a QT Py - S2 as part of my CircuitPythonukiah
   * This week
   * Hosting the Community Help Desk this Thursday to help people get set up for Hacktoberfest
   * Reviewing all of the outstanding type annotation PRs
   * Continuing to work on the GitHub Action for adding MPY files to releases
   * Reviving the work I previously did to add Image Transfer to the Bluefruit Connect library - I almost deleted all my progress during a clean up of my repositories, but the microcontroller I previously used for testing had the code!


## In The Weeds


@david.glaude (not speaking):
   * Should we have “camera” as a feature in circuitpython.org (and what board)?
   * Please have a look at this issue, speak out or put comment and once the dust settle I will make a PR: https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython-org/issues/1053


49:24 @tekktrik
   * Is there any issue merging this API-breaking PR?  The intention is to force users to be more explicit about providing arguments so they aren’t set incorrectly.
   * https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_MiniMQTT/pull/121#issuecomment-1257294489
   * No libraries or guides I could find use __init__() with positional arguments anyway.


55:16 @danh - How to document incomplete implementations of native modules?
   * Notes per board and/or per port? Where would they go and how would they be maintained?
   * https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/6930 is an example (partial Espressif BLE support).
## Wrap-Up
