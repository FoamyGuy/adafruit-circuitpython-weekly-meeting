## 14:56 Hug reports
15:24 @jepler (hosting; please leave at top)
* Group hug for everyone who has contributed to the 7.2.0 release. Not only those credited on github as authors and reviewers, but also those who shared ideas, filed bug reports, tested their projects with pre-releases, etc.


15:54 @CGrover (not attending today)
* To the team and community for the newest release. I continue to be amazed by the pace and quality of the collective community process.
* To yesterday’s wise mentors that encouraged and pushed me forward into a rewarding life-long passion for electronics and music (and all the wonderful trappings and friends that come with the territory). 
* To today’s mentors that nurture and strengthen the fabric of new interests, acquired skills, and knowledge.


16:27 @danh
* Thanks to all who helped with the 7.2.0 release.
* @t-ikegami for getting _asyncio/_uasyncio working (native module helper for asyncio).
* @Rimwolf-Redux for looking at type annotation issues in their PR.


17:46 @foamyguy
* Adafruit for always striving to do the right thing and serve as role models during the crazy events the world throws at all of us. Many companies are most interested in keeping a “low profile“ and doing everything in their power to continue the status quo unless or until they are directly affected.
* @Kattni and pt for going out of their way to ensure open communication is possible and assisting me in being comfortable as a new member of the team.
* @ATMakersBill for diving through various layers of source code to learn about a specific quirk with DotStars that I ran across on stream and sharing the knowledge that they found.
* @danh and anyone who contributed to CircuitPython 7.2.0 stable release
* Group hug to everyone in this wonderful community


19:13 @jerryn (missing the meeting today)
* Group hug.


19:22 @kattni 
* @brentru for reviewing some Adafruit IO / MQTT code for me, and cleaning it up a little. I’ve not dealt with MQTT before, and had no idea what it should look like, or what a couple of sections were doing. Brent moved a couple of things around, and added a few comments, and cleared all of that up! He also provided a guide with MQTT explanations for me to read and link to - so helpful!
* @anecdata for giving me a place to start with troubleshooting a silent failure in some CircuitPython code
* @lemon of the Python Discord for providing me with some code and a ton of resources for a new project for me that will be a serious learning experience, and for putting in the time to help with it!


20:32 @makermelissa
* Everybody involved in getting CircuitPython 7.2.0 out.
* Group hug to everyone who kept things going while I was out last week.
* Raspberry Pi for turning 10 today.


21:18 @mark[gamblor] (missing today)
* @danh for asyncio. Finally had a chance to try asyncio out and it made a project even easier to create.


@tammymakesthings (not attending today)
* Group hug to everyone for being awesome!


@tekktrik
* @kattni for giving me opportunities to work on library infrastructure - I'm already using my learnings like CI in my own projects
* Anyone who worked on the Release Actions for libraries - being able to build .mpy files and attach to releases automatically is fantastic
* @foamyguy for the insightful commentary while reviewing my PR on stream
* Anyone who's worked on adafruit_wsgi - it's by far my favorite library to tinker with
* Group hug!
## 22:22 Status Updates
22:40 @jepler (hosting; please leave at top)
* Last week:
   * Wrote and released a guide about modifying a PC floppy drive to read “flippy” disks with FluxEngine or GreaseWeazle (and Adafruit’s upcoming GreaseWeazle-compatible board)
   * Got an Apple ][ computer for floppy testing
   * Got my Apple ][ floppy drive moving its read/write head under the control of CircuitPython
* This week:
   * Hopefully picking up some small CircuitPython work
   * Giving a talk “From Zero To CircuitPython” this Saturday for the Dublin Linux Users’ Group


23:59 @CGrover (not attending today)
* Wrapped up two of three PCB projects. The final one is on hold needing some SMD FeatherWing sockets. Was certain that there were more in the inventory.
* Modified two PyBadge-LTs to expand their usefulness – they can sport add-on FeatherWings now. Oh, that’s where the SMD FeatherWing sockets went.
* Finally got around to creating that CircuitPython Atari Punk Console emulator I’ve been thinking about for a few years. The new class accepts the traditional Oscillator Frequency and One-Shot Pulse Width input values and develops the resultant waveform on a PWM-capable output pin. Tests on an RP2040 Feather dramatically outperformed the original NE555 analog circuit and needed to be throttled-back in order to stay in the range of human hearing. Should be relatively simple to add MIDI and Eurorack CV features. 
   * Repo: https://github.com/CedarGroveStudios/Punk_Console
   * Annoying stereo demo reel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WQlkPeqx8w 


25:14 @danh
* Released CircuitPython 7.2.0 stable.
* Preparing for 7.3.0-alpha.1
* Working on a number of related type annotation issues spread across libraries, the circuitpython_typing library, and the circuitpython build, both stubs and documentation. Some fixes are already merged. Moving type definitions around, and learning more about how to manage them.
* Wrote but not yet tested an async HTTP client.


27:35 @foamyguy
* Last Week
   * Ran cookie-cutter for new Register_SPI library that was from some code originally submitted as a PR to Register library. Also created an issue: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Register_SPI/issues/1 to collect feedback about what other steps are needed to get the Library ready for release.
   * Improvements to PyPortal Winamp project: support for PyPortal Titano, and auto-generating playlist by searching for mp3 files on the sdcard.
   * Update root certificate in nina-fw repo and make PR to bump to the latest version in circuitpython core repo.
* This week
   * Updating the Webb Telescope project to use the newer more direct JSON data source (which was the original motivation for the certificate things from above)
   * Potentially help out with new Discord bot functionality
   * Catch up on the gzip PR from the core
   * Joining Scott to chat for a bit on Deep Dive this Friday.


30:24 @kattni
* Last week:
   * Worked on more templates for both CircuitPython and Arduino for reading the LC709203
   * Started Adafruit IO template
   * Caught the Adafruit IO example hanging with no error. Got suggestions to try troubleshooting (late Friday, so it waits until today)
   * Worked on Arduino template page for built in TFT
   * Submitted some fixes to the Arduino ST7735/ST7789 library.
   * Updated the BNO055 CircuitPython page to not mention Feather M0 because the library no longer works on M0.
   * Misc
* This week:
   * Troubleshoot Adafruit IO CPU temperature example hanging
   * Finish templates
   * Finish Feather TFT guide
   * Guide for Feather ESP32 V2 - will include Arduino and MicroPython (if I can get MP going).
   * Update the Bluefruit LE Connect Basics guide to include a question from the forums
   * MCP23017 I2C GPIO Expander Breakout guide
   * New TFT guide
   * VL53VCD guide
   * Template for asyncio
* Offtime:
   * Working on a house Discord bot for the Adafruit Discord server initially to have a lack-of-code-formatting flag feature


37:17 @makermelissa
* Last Week:
   * I was out pretty much all week due to health issues, so I didn't get much done.
   * Added Type Annotations to the PlatformDetect repository
* This week:
   * Catching up on stuff because of last week
   * Preparing to give a talk for Dublin Linux Developers this Weekend


37:57 @tammymakesthings (not attending today)
* Was on vacation for part of the week so didn’t get as much time to work on things as I’d like. But last week, I worked on the design of my CircuitPython library for representing and drawing decks of cards, and I fixed my HDMI inputs so I can use my better camera for my Twitch stream.
* This week I’m planning to do 1-2 Twitch streams (tonight at 7pm MST, and either Thursday evening or on the weekend. I also hope to set up a regular schedule for streaming (twitch.tv/tammymakesthings), and to start implementing my Card Deck library.


38:54 @tekktrik
* Last week:
   * Finished my EdgeBadge Discord companion project
   * Added more effects to the DisplayIO Effects library in CircuitPython Org
   * More type annotations
* This week:
   * Regrouping and finding out what's up next


## 39:14 In The Weeds
@dexter: Consider establishing a __Trail Rating__ system for various development tasks. Correcting a typo would be a 0, porting to a new microprocessor would be a 10.


45:46 @mark[gamblor]: Cannot be here but if there is a broad agreement on the zlib module names (PR 6069) I can start to work to update that in the next couple of weeks. This can always wait a week or for another time if it is easier to discuss then.
## 51:41 Wrap-Up
March 7,  2022 is the next meeting
