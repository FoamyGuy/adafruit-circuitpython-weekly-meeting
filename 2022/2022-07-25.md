### 2:58 A New Version of CircuitPython 7 is Released
CircuitPython 7.3.2 is the latest bugfix revision of CircuitPython, and is a new stable release - [GitHub](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases).
Notable changes to 7.3.2 since 7.3.1:
* Adafruit MatrixPortal: restore traceback, which allows asyncio use.
* Always release displays during deep sleep.
* Update frozen libraries: fixes issues due to older libraries on certain AirLift boards.

Below is the latest on events that are developing. Firm times and additional events will be posted in subsequent posts.
#### Special events will be held during the day – the following is a summary of events known to date:
* A panel discussion with Kattni, Jeff, Dan, and Tim. Hosted by Paul Cutler. More details coming soon!
* A chat with Jeff, Dan and Kattni. This will be the third year in a row that Jeff, Dan and Kattni will sit down and chat about their involvement and latest favorite contribution to CircuitPython.
* Special Edition CircuitPython Themed Show and Tell, hosted by Liz Clark. Details are still being solidified, but start prepping your CircuitPython related projects if you’re interested in participating!
#### 6:23 Foamyguy CircuitPython Day Game Jam Stream:


> On CircuitPython Day, I’ll be combining 2 of my favorite things, CircuitPython and Games. I will stream the making of a CircuitPython game jam game. My goal will be to make a basic but playable and fun game within the time constraints of a few hours, and I’ll be streaming the process. After the stream, I will publish the code to the game so folks can play on their own CircuitPython devices.
#### (6:57) Reimagining IoT Deployments with CircuitPython 11:00 AM EDT/5:00 PM CEST 


Adafruit’s CircuitPython has helped open up the IoT and place it within reach of developers of all types. Join us on CircuitPython Day as we look at:
* Getting Started with CircuitPython and Wireless IoT
* Walking Through a Real World CircuitPython-based IoT Project
* Remotely Updating CircuitPython Firmware with Cellular IoT(!?!)

* Had an extended discussion with Jeff on ESP32 troubleshooting.
* Testing why ESP32SPI is failing with various test cases offered by users.
* Understanding the fine points of using sockets better.


23:49 @Askpatrickw
* 2 weeks ago I made a board definition for the [DFRobot Beetle ESP32-C3](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/6615) (link to PR). This board is a bit odd as it has no Mode or Reset button, in the CP.org board page I included a drawing and steps on how to get it into firmware flashing mode.
* This Beetle also comes with an add-on prototyping and display cable board which sits on hat-style (connects to all the pins). I need to look at how other boards have handled this. It is unclear if it should be in the board definition or if it should be handled in a library. Tracking in [CP #6616](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/6616)
* This week I am planning to do a board definition for the [M5 Stamp C3](https://docs.m5stack.com/en/core/stamp_c3) (link to product). No specific reason for these boards, just wanted to practice making board definitions and the C3 boards are very affordable.


25:02 @david.glaude (not present or text only)
* CP:
   * Testing and promoting discotool from @neradoc
   * No progress on my Web Workflow test and usage
* Non CP:
   * (WIP) Changing the brain of my Nabaztag with tagtagtag, an adaptation board that use a PiZeroW


25:33 @deshipu
* Just got a PAJ7620 gesture sensor working with CP, hoping to make a proper library.
* Working on my Fluffbug robots now.


26:56 @DexterStarboard (text only)
* Looking forward to #CircuitPythonDay2022. Posted related video on #show-and-tell: https://discord.com/channels/327254708534116352/334905778857050125/999955423752900689
* Testing web workflow on FunHouse, UM ProS3.


27:19 @foamyguy
* Continued Octopus game guide
* Diving into Hack Tablet branch in the core and made some tweaks to FramebufferDisplay to add a configuration that forces it to refresh each frame even if no dirty regions present. This allows the dotclock display on the tablet to keep looking nice.
* Further tweaks around lower refresh rate to alleviate some visual artifacts when there are drawn frames without visual changes
* Made a multi-touch example and started planning for a PortalBase style helper library for the Hack Tablet.
* Publishing announcement and Instructions for the Hack Tablet give away this afternoon.
* Planning for CircuitPython day activities


28:42 @jepler
* Several people asked why we uploaded all libraries to PyPI. The answer is that this helps Thonny work better, as the way it installs libs (on a CircuitPython device) is by querying PyPI. Thonny developer Aivar (@aivarannamaa on github) preferred this to a circup-style approach and we agreed to go with it. Aivar intends to add support for mpy-compiling files at a later date.
* Last week:
   * ESP32 Feather V1 now boots, but with caveats. Pull request is open
      * Still some weirdness when disabling PSRAM entirely, so it’s “turned on but optional”. This means some GPIOs are not usable because they’re also used for PSRAM.
   * Non-CircuitPython: learned about QMK support for OLED displays
   * (today) got KB2040 & STEMMA QT OLED display working together in QMK
* This week:
   * Wrapping QMK guide
   * Writing learn system profile page
   * Investigate adding imagecapture support to esp32-s3
   * Lower activity on some days, a friend is staying with us for the week
   * CircuitPython day planning as needed
   * Planning to be OUT August 11-18


32:07 @kattni
* Last week:
   * Finished adding WipperSnapper Setup/Usage pages to three guides. 
   * Started on the WS Usage page for a fourth guide.
   * Continued CircuitPython Day planning
   * Short week.
* Long weekend:
   * Tore down two “walls” and a bunch of built-in shelving.
      * Learned 100 times over how NOT to build things.
   * Framed in four walls into two rooms
   * Drywalled the entire thing
   * Got through two coats of drywall mud.
   * Pretty sure we have everything we need to finish it. 
* This week:
   * Finish up the WipperSnapper Usage page for PyPortal.
   * Pick up more guides needing WS Setup/Usage pages
   * Various misc assignments.
   * Short week. (Monday-Wednesday.)
* Tuesday:
   * Installing doors.
* Evenings:
   * Finish mudding.
* Upcoming long weekend:
   * Cleaning up, priming.
   * Maybe painting the outside walls.
   * Maybe installing an iron filter.


34:11 @kmatch
* Minor debugging on the ESP32-S3 RGB DotClockDisplay module supporting the HACKtablet
* Built five more HACKtablets for the giveaway (contact @foamyguy)
* Tested a time of flight sensor to measure a passing sphere (bowling ball) data looks promising.
* This week: Dig into basic signal processing to make sense out of the measurement pulse for the bowling training aid.
* Will take a few days off of work to visit family. 


35:11 @makermelissa
* Last week:
   * Worked with Edge Impulse to figure out how to train a Machine Learning model
   * Created an example to get the machine learning model running on a KB2040
   * Started taking a look at code.circuitpython.org to see what needed to be updated to start adding Web Workflow into it
* This Week:
   * Start working on refactoring code.circuitpython.org so it can have Web Workflow added
   * Add in Web Workflow
   * Possibly work on writing up a guide about the Edge Impulse stuff I worked on last week
   * Working on preparations for a CircuitPython Day Livestream


36:06 @Neradoc (text only)
* Last week:
   * Continuing work on “web circup” for the web workflow, PR’ed fixes to access control

## 39:00 In The Weeds

In FramebufferDisplay I am interested in making a constructor argument that exposes this native_frames_per_sec for configuration.
https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/blob/d8dfd4f63aedd5c6740b1b9282e6be537f8d0d94/shared-module/framebufferio/FramebufferDisplay.c#L91
We’ve found that the current default (60) can lead to some visual artifacts on the hack tablet display, but lower rates seem to alleviate it. Am interested in feedback around this option or others I might be not considering.
