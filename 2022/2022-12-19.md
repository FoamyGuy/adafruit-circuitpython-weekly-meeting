Issue Uploading UF2 files with macOS 13.0 Ventura Fixed in Version 13.1
 Uploading UF2 files with macOS 

Uploading UF2 file issues with macOS 13.0 Ventura have been fixed in Version 13.1. Not all is perfect, though. It is still the case that UF2 uploading does not work on nRF52840 boards that use an older UF2 bootloader (versions 0.6.2 and newer work). On those boards, the bootloader appears to fail quickly, allowing no time to copy the UF2. The bootloader can be updated by following the directions here. Otherwise, on these nRF52840 boards, including the Adafruit Circuit Playground Bluefruit, the Feather nRF52840, and the ItsyBitsy nRF52840, the only way to load a UF2 file is to use a non-Ventura computer.
It is also still true that copying .hex files larger than 1MB does not work (e.g., on the micro:bit). See ARMmbed/DAPLink#982 for workarounds and further investigation - Adafruit Blog and Raspberry Pi.

Project of the Week: A Runner's Headlight
 Runner's Headlight 

The Metanerd Headlight Mk. 2
The Mk. 1 was a success in the sense that it was made entirely from leftover parts from unrelated earlier projects, but I wasn't really satisfied with the design. Particularly the area around the two close range LEDs bothered me and I also felt like it could be a little more compact.
 
Enter Mk. 2. Not only is it physically smaller and uses less power, it also looks much more professionally designed. It has the same control and the same mix of close and long range lights. Close range: 2 x 1W with 90 deg lens and angled down 15 degrees to illuminate the ground immediately in front of and around me. Long range: 1 x 3W with 5 degree lens for a focused cone of light so I can see far ahead.

## 20:11 Status Updates
20:42 @Jeff
* closed pull request in adafruit/circuitpython: "Revert "update protomatter to latest commit""
* Need to further investigate protomatter stuff, but this gets it working again on esp32s3 with psram 
* Further fixes to showing the special “gaierror” exception for name lookup failures
* This week: 8.0.0 bugs and adding the mouse to the NeXT keyboard guide. (1 new research page, plus updating the program & its explanation)
* Looks like the 3d printed scorpio tree project will not make it for xmas, so we’ll need a fresh idea.
* Looking for an alternative online calendar viewer for the meeting calendar, the existing one is gone


23:48 @danh
* Fixed about four issues for CircuitPython 8.0.0.
* I could not reproduce some more issues and closed them or asked for more info.
* Pushed some issues forward to 8.x.x.
* Will do a CircuitPython 8.0.0-beta.6 by about Wednesday, with `settings.toml`, and possibly some other features, depending on which PR’s are finished by then.
* Investigating mysterious crashes when compiling DEBUG=1, having to do with raising AttributeError, and with various compiler flags. Had to do a manual bisect to find the suspicious commit. A couple of other exception-handling bugs may be related to all this, perhaps uninitialized storage?? This is all mysterious at the moment.


26:04 @deshipu
* coming back to some of the projects that were on hold
* finally got the custom OV2640 camera shield for Lolin S2 Mini working, shield for Pi Pico coming
* the xclk pin is now optional with esp32-cam
* got plover-hid for USB-based stenotypes working
* got PewPew libraries to work on Solderparty's Flux handheld
* new driver for the PAJ7620 gesture sensor
* working on a version of Fluffbug spider robot using pi pico w
* progress with the electronic ocarina


29:55 @DJDevon3
* Spent my entire week learning everything I could about Fusion 360 & Cura slicer. Printing PLA is a piece of cake compared to PETG. My goal was to 3D print orange step switches for the TR-Cowbell because that specific color is unavailable from Adafruit. The step switch caps require a precision of 0.12mm. It took 22 revisions before getting it just right. Fusion 360 automatically appends file save version numbers so if you really want to know how many times you fail before succeeding, use Fusion 360.
* The PB86 Step Switch 3D model was submitted as a PR & added to Adafruit CAD Parts this morning: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CAD_Parts/tree/main/5499%20PB86-A1R 
* Happy holidays! The first batch of version 1.2 TR-Cowbells should be arriving today & tomorrow to the Circuit Pythonista’s who wanted one. Some kits are missing a few extra’s (such as SSD1306 display, encoder knob, DIP socket, etc..) as I ran out of supplies but all core components to get the board working are included. Those who wanted a kit vs a fully assembled board was about 50% which really surprised me. I figured everyone would want a fully assembled board. One lucky person with a fully assembled board will also receive a magnetic micro-b plug stuck in the end of the Pico because I forgot to take it out before packaging. 
* Currently designing the TR-Cowbell v1.3 with RGB LED’s and other new features. Looking forward to feedback from v1.2 owners to make the next iteration even better.
* Hope everyone has a nice holiday season. Will see everyone again in 2023.


32:21 @foamyguy
* PR reviews and testing. Ethernet library fixes and Logging library ability to have multiple handlers to output logging information to more than one place were a few that I found particularly interesting recently.
* Cookiecut and publish to Github a library with some helper functions for generating gradient color palettes. https://github.com/FoamyGuy/Foamyguy_CircuitPython_GradientHelper. Will added it to the community bundle soon. So far I have been able to make use of the gradient palettes with displayio Bitmaps, vectorio shapes, as well as neopixel strips and animations running on them.
* Upcoming weeks:
   * Try out interfacing with a barcode scanner that I got. It can connect via USB or UART. I’ve unboxed it, but not powered it up at all yet. I’m hoping to get it working with a circuitpython device and ultimately want to create some sort of handheld toy that interacts with barcodes. I recently discovered Skannerz, a commercial product from the early 00s that was a virtual pet with barcode scanner integrated. I was past the age demo for it by the time it was available so I missed it, but have played with and created similar ideas in mobile apps before and have always been fascinated and intrigued by barcodes and using them as an input for some sort of game. 
   * Build and play with DJDevons Cowbell sequencer once it arrives.
   * Probably lots more, including ample video games, but unsure of other specific. I will be around and streaming some without a set schedule during the time off of work.


35:57 @MakerMelissa
* Last 2 Weeks:
   * Took some time off because a close friend had passed away rather suddenly
   * Refactored USB Workflow on code.circuitpython.org to make use of the File System Access API for a more consistent experience.
   * Working on polishing it up with handling things like partial connections and the ability to run code via the REPL
* This Week:
   * Finish up the USB Workflow
   * Start working on integrating Web Serial ESPTool into the main circuitpython.org site for ESP boards
        
@tammymakesthings (missing meeting)
* Spent last week buried in day job work, so not much time for CircuitPython.
* Hoping to get back to my NRPN extensions to the `adafruit_midi` library, and the project I’m intending to use it for, this week.
* Trying to reset my schedule for 2023 to make more space for the things that matter to me outside of my day job.


37:30 @tannewt
* Split week last week due to travel on Wednesday. (Ari did well on the planes!)
* Went heads down on debugging ULP deep sleep on the S3. Found an IDF issue causing me trouble.
* Writing #CircuitPython2023 post and scheduling it for New Year’s Day.
* Working today and tomorrow with the goal of merging the coproc API rework. Back ⅓
* Dusting off wa-law.org in prep for next legislative session starting 1/9. Made a requests wrapper that caches past responses: https://github.com/tannewt/url-history

41:13 @tekktrik (text only)
* Last week
   * Implemented draft PR status display and Community Bundle updates in the weekly meeting report
   * Took my embedded systems II grad course exam, thanks everyone in this community for teaching me a lot about the material, and also giving me the confidence to enroll despite not taking the prerequisite ;)
      * Very excited for Principles & Applications of Sensors for Engineering next semester, sounds fun and relevant to making cool robot friends
   * Helped keep adabot running smoothly over the holidays, fixing a bug with displaying draft PRs that was implemented recently.
   * Built roughly 15 CircuitPythonukiahs and now sending them to friends and family
* This week
   * Reviewing security warning for adabot - probably best to not share specifics, but I don’t think it’s an issue for us based on the described risk, so I don’t think changes are necessary.  Happy to discuss privately with any of the maintainers who want a more detailed explanation - see the security tab in the adabot repository for more information.
   * Headed to Nevada for the holidays, so I’m “logging off” starting this week until the next weekly meeting, but will have my dev laptop with me.  Please don’t hesitate to ping me if any CI stops working, but things are stable now!
## 42:29 In The Weeds
43:03 @tannewt - How long should we wait to close #CircuitPython2023? Looks like last year we posted the summary at February 1st.


## 45:50 Wrap-Up
There’s no meeting the week of December 26 due to the US holiday, and the next meeting after that is postponed by one day. The next meeting is Tuesday January 3, 2023. We hope to see you then!
