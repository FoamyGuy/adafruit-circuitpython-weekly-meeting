## 30:38 Status Updates


31:05 @danh (host)
* Released CircuitPython 8.0.0-beta.0, with over two months of changes.
* Continuing to fix issues for 8.0.0.


31:31 @CGrover (not attending)
* Inspired by @foamyguy’s state machine coding approach, I spent the week refactoring an old but favorite Eurorack hysteresis-based quantizer module called RangeSlicer. Also upgraded it from CircuitPython v5.3 to v7.3. Code is easier to read and module performance improved by 40%.
* When the module refactoring is completed, it’ll be adjusted to power two new rack modules that use the same custom PCB board as RangeSlicer. Hope to have ZYComp and an HP test equipment-inspired Precision VCO working soon.
* Since we are seeing more 100F+ sun days, the extensive outdoor wind chime and wind sock collection is experiencing simultaneous UV-related materials failures. I’m restringing everything, substituting new materials, and applying UV-protective coatings where possible. I’m assuming that the neighbors will appreciate hearing the late night windstorm concerts again.


32:37 @david.glaude (not speaking)
* CircuitPython.org improvement:
   * Some typo modification so that all boards of the same manufacturer match exactly
   * Adding “Solderparty bbq20kbd”
* Suggesting improvement to learn guide:
   * https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website (force aspect width and height when using ezgif.com)
   * https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython (talk about creator ID vs USB PID/VID for ESP32 board)
* Reporting an old BLE bug when emulating mouse on two separate devices simultaneously
* Testing I2CTarget on RP2040
* Searching the box with all of my ESP32 boards (fail)


33:55 @foamyguy
* Last week
   * Circuitpython day participation in panel and game jam stream
   * Learn about building debug version of core builds and use it to collect logs about a hard fault. Used for troubleshooting the HackTablet build
   * Submit preliminary PR for measuring mpy file size from an actions task
   * Submit octopus guide for review
* This week
   * Figure out how to use if conditions inside actions to limit the mpy size check to occur only if the changed version is different by a big enough margin
   * Move the script for measuring mpy size to a repo in the circuitpython org
   * Try out mpy-tool and learn its capabilities. See if it can be helpful for the size / memory measurement effort
   * Start publishing walkthrough videos that show how to set up a Minecraft server and the plugins needed to create a virtual feather sync’d with a physical one


36:36 @jepler
* Last week: Traveling. CircuitPython day
* Today: Helping move a 4-ton (8300 lbs/3765 kg) CNC machine across town. As of this morning it’s at the front of the garage it’s leaving, and by evening it has to be at its new place. We’ve got an appropriate trailer & equipment to load and unload it, but where the power equipment can’t reach it’s a slow process of a couple feet per hour to move the thing on rollers. Update: It’s inside the new shop, yay! It’ll be a process to get it moving again just due to its complexity.  
* Rest of week: Probably investigating & maybe starting on pi-cow wifi module support. First question: to fit the firmware blob how much else do we have to give up in CircuitPython? Next after that would probably be to get the LED to blink via the wifi module.


39:09 @kattni
   * Last week:
   * Fixed up I2S and I2C templates for a discontinued product and terminology update respectively
   * Merged a couple of PRs
   * Continued coordinating CircuitPython day in the days leading up to it
   * CircuitPython Day!
   * This week:
   * Finish up S3 TFT Feather guide
   * Start working with ESP32 V2 WiFi and deep sleep in preparation for a WiFi version of my mailbox notifier project.
   * Update CP ESP32 Quickstart guide to have more thorough Thonny section now that support has been released
   * Mailbox Notifier project guide. May include LoRa version as well as WiFi.
   * Find bugs with the ESP32 CircuitPython setup
   * Use Thonny as my IDE to test using it with CP and ESP32
   * Update the main guide for the Quad Alphanumeric backpack; now with STEMMA QT
   * A countdown project guide using three of the Quad Alphanumeric STEMMA QT backpacks.


41:05 @kmatch (text only)
   * Tested the adafruit ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04 variant) to capture the distance to a rapidly passing sphere (bowling ball).  I think it's fast enough!


41:25 @makermelissa
   * Last Week:
   * Created a loader script so that the entire code.circuitpython.org website will load from the device
   * Started adding some of the new boards to circuitpython.org
   * Finished up the code for the robot I built on my livestream
   * Lots of preparation for my CircuitPython Day live stream
   * Co-hosted Show and Tell again but in the lead role
   * Live streamed on CircuitPython Day
   * Started moving out of my offices over the weekend
   * This Week:
   * Finish adding the rest of the boards to circuitpython.org
   * Continue working on adding Web Workflow to code.circuitpython.org
   * If any time left, possibly start on a guide
   * Probably more office moving/packing


42:34 @tammymakesthings
   * Last week:
   * Participated in the CircuitPython Day Dev sprint and had some fun collaboration and discussion
   * PR Reviews:
   * https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Debouncer/pull/40 (added comments)
   * This week: Unknown (work has been bonkers)


43:17 @tekktrik (text only)
   * Last week:
   * Hosted the CircuitPython Day mini dev sprints along with a few others in the community
   * Started submitting fixes how adabot generates the Infrastructure Issues page on circuitpython.org
   * Added additional typing protocols to circuitpython_typing
   * Updated all the version strings that typically get replaced to be compatible with PEP 440 so editable installs work again
   * Fixed an issue with the neopixel library where chained dependencies weren’t being recorded in the wheel that was built for PyPI causing downloads via pip to fail
   * This week:
   * Continue working on patching and improving adabot to handle recent updates to the libraries
   * Catch up on a bunch of type annotation PRs
   * Implement a patch for allowing Sphinx to keep the copyright date up-to-date each time the documentation is built
   * Add additional cookiecutter updates


44:26 @AnneB (text only)
             I will be blogging about the NASA Artemis I moon rocket launch and behind the scenes as a social media selectee by NASA. Look on the Adafruit Blog, Twitter, and my Twitter @anne_engineer through into early next week.
## 45:00 In The Weeds
45:25 Making CircuitPython Dev Sprints a regular activity  (@tammymakesthings)
   * During the CPY Day Dev sprints, the idea came up of making the Dev Sprints a regular activity (monthly/quarterly/…?) with one or two people willing to sign up to be available for a given block of time to help beginners with Git setup, toolchain setup, answers to “where/how do I get started?” type of questions, etc.[a]
   * This could be a good way to lower the barriers of entry for newcomers who want to get involved with CircuitPython but who want a bit more interactive guidance than just reading a bunch of learn guides and diving into the Discord.
   * I know I would have felt less intimidated when I first joined the community if such a thing existed.
   * On a monthly or quarterly cadence, it wouldn’t take much scheduling coordination and it wouldn't take very many volunteers to make the burden on any given participant manageable.


53:37 @danh - what to remove from MatrixPortal to make room for frozen libraries: ulab or BLE support?
## 57:50 Wrap-Up
[a]Love this idea - some communities and Discord communities host "office hours" where they are available the same time every week or every month, etc.  Maybe for example the first Friday of every month from 1-5pm EST are office hours / sprints.
