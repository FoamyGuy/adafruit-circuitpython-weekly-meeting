   * Group hug


18:51 @Mark(gamblor) [ missing, vaccine booster time ]
   * PT for starting Ask An Engineer with my eye video. Was cool to see it there.

   * Group hug!


## 19:52 Status Updates
20:33 @danh (hosting)
   * Spent several days on the ESP32-C3 toolchain problem: solved as a group effort with @jepler and @MicroDev. Released CircuitPython 8.0.0-beta.3. Expect an 8.0.0-beta.4 soon with ESP32-C3 working again.
   * Added “limitations” information about various features and modules to the FAQ in the _Welcome to CircuitPython Guide_, some board guides, and the ReadTheDocs module documentation.
   * Back to fixing issues for 8.0.0. Now working on some sleep issues.


23:02 @CGrover (text only; just listening today)
   * Submitted four more helpers to the Community Bundle. Working on three or four more before putting a fork in this activity and moving on to other projects.
   * Working on an approach to generalize the adaptive low-pass filter used in the ShadowWatcher light sensor gesture detector class. Would be useful for noisy real-time sensor projects.
   * This weekend was the annual rain gutter cleaning ritual. The two-story extension for the leaf blower that I picked up at a clearance sale made it easy to clear the gutters from the ground. The drawback is getting covered in debris as you look up to position the nozzle. It’s a rite of passage, I guess. 


23:53 @DGlaude (text)
   * I tested beta3 on a few devices especially picow (hug to Dan and Jepler)
   * Did some FlipClock tests and PR (hug to foamyguy, tekktrik, maybe other)
   * Acquired: 2 trinket M0, 2 QT Py RP2040 and 2 Xiao RP2040 for future AT(maker) use, USB host trick.


24:21 @DJDevon3
   * Submitted detailed feedback on the new User Pages where multiple features were broken in Chrome & Firefox. They’re now fixed and User Pages are working correctly in all browsers.
   * Finished my 7-segment social media counter project. It uses 4 separate API’s in one script. The Adafruit Feather ESP32-S2 handles it like a champ.
   * Pushed a PR to the adafruit_requests library to have them included as separate API examples (not in 1 script). Split them apart and ensured every API was working separately then pushed a PR. They’re all waiting to be reviewed by a brave soul who must have a developer API account for each of those sites to test and confirm they’re good to go.
   * Put the finishing touches on the Neopixel Goggle Kit build. Re-cut the mirrored lenses so they’re not so bubbly around the edges anymore. Accomplished my goal of making them a real wearable and with slightly better aesthetic thanks to the mirror film.
   * Starting on a pumpkin for the Digikey #HackaPumpkin challenge tonight which ends this Thursday. I will be using my non-existent carving skills to gouge some lines for a couple noods. Since Anne went with a Space Coast theme for her halloween project I’ll be responding with a Treasure Coast themed pumpkin. For those that don’t know Florida geography that well, the Space Coast & Treasure Coast are regional neighbors.
   * Turned Todbot’s QT eyes into alligator eyes for my halloween dragon mask for handing out candy this year. 
   * Because Halloween projects and Hacktoberfest have deadlines I put off working on my sequencer cowbell and other projects until after Halloween.


26:34 @foamyguy
   * Last week
      * Submitted a PR for http server library to return smaller chunks to workaround an issue on pico w. 
      * Tested the root fix for that issue after it was in the core
      * Built out a displayio version of the Trivia game that uses a small 1.8” display for output and a 1x4 neokey for input. The game is fully functional, user can select their category and how many questions. It tracks score and allows you to start over after the game is finished.
      * Modified a previously created ListSelect widget to make it possible to scroll through lists that are too big to fit on the display. This was used for the category selection in the trivia game.
   * This week
      * Library PR reviews and testing
      * Modify the trivia game for a 2.8” display with larger resolution. The existing one is a bit cramped and some of the longer strings get cut off. 
      * Once I’m happy with the UI on the larger screen I will try to come up with a project container to keep everything in as a convenient handheld device. 
      * Used a pico w inside of an industrial control button to send signals to my PC via USB serial, and then ultimately translate into commands to send into a running factorio server. This allows me to control things inside the game using the physical buttons and key on my controller. First test was to use it as a launch button for the rocket.


29:15 @jepler
   * Last week:
      * Ported DOOM to the ESP32-S3-Feather for a little gag video that Phil B made: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V_ofcX9cic
      * The bulk of the asyncio fixes & improvements were merged, will be in the next beta (may have been in beta 3?)
      * Fixed an obscure hardfault when assigning to the __traceback__ property of a GeneratorExit object
      * Fixed a bug on Pico W where use of the GPIO pins attached to the wifi coprocessor could interfere with ‘regular’ pins
      * Fixed a bug on Pico W where certain pins didn’t work with pio, or features that used pio such as PulseIn
      * Implemented static network configuration on Pico W
      * A few tiny, tiny doc fixes
      * A few updates to the Github Actions build process of various Adafruit repos
      * Accepted multiple requests for USB PIDs in pidcodes.org
      * Worked on a higher level wrapper of programs for Coproc, currently living at https://github.com/jepler/ulp-circuitpython
   * This week:
      * Uncertain. My partner tested positive for COVID yesterday after we spent a lot of time in close contact, so it seems likely I will also be sick soon (she is doing OK, and we have a good support network in case we need something; don’t worry about us)
      * Goals/hopes are to continue with Coproc, write IBM PC keyboard adapter guide, squash 8.0.0 bugs


32:10 @kattni
   * Last week:
      * Caught up from being out for two weeks
      * Put the LTR-329 / LTR-303 guide into moderation
      * Guide feedback
      * Created the PCF8575 guide
   * This week:
      * Update the Pico CircuitPython board def to have the STEMMA_I2C() singleton for use with PiCowbells.
      * PCF8575 guide
      * Waiting on Eva to finish a series of PCB repos for various boards, and then I will be emailing the New Products team to add to the related product pages.
      * A bunch of misc.
      * A huge list of other stuff, but thankfully, I’ve been told to focus on one thing at a time, so the PCF guide comes first.


34:32 @Paul Cutler
   * Finished my 32x8 NeoPixel audio reactive project
   * New episode of The Bootloader out today, with todbot talking about CircuitPython’s ulab and more


34:53 @tammymakesthings (missing meeting)
   * Started work on an idea for using CircuitPython to control my Novation Circuit groovebox/synth. This is going to require extending Adafruit_MIDI to be able to generate MIDI NRPN (Non Registered Parameter Number) messages, so researching what those look like. 
   * On vacation for my birthday so this week is going to be a bit chaotic. 


35:21 @tekktrik (text only)
   * Last week
      * Mostly housework and the like, excited to pick up more CircuitPython things again
      * Keeping up with some PRs
      * Working on the unified CI actions for the CircuitPython libraries
   * This week
      * Starting a pastebin helper library for dumping text using services like PasteBin.com, which could be helpful for dumping error texts or messages for applications where a screen or serial connection isn’t wanted.
      * Preparing for a very spooky Community Help Desk on Halloween night (Oct 31st at 7pm EST) to go over PRs and anything else people come with!  I’ll try to find non-Turing complete candy to snack on! (Thanks @jepler!)
      * Following through with a backlog of patches to the libraries, starting with the unified composite actions.
      * Focusing on making sure all the contributions for Hacktoberfest are counted, and going to try to give a preliminary review now so changes can be made before the deadline
      * Generally, taking a look at everything on my To Do list from before moving and spin it all back up again.  If I owe you something, please let me know!
