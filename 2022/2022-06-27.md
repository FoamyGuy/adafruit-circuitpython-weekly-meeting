### CircuitPython 7.3.1 Released
CircuitPython 7.3.1 is the latest bugfix revision of CircuitPython and is the new stable release - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/06/22/circuitpython-7-3-1-released/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases).
Notable changes to 7.3.1 since 7.3.0:
* Adafruit MatrixPortal: fix ESP32SPI hang.
* Espressif: fix use of multiple rotaryio.IncrementalEncoder objects.
* nRF: fix crash when waking up from sleep when a display is in use.
* Update frozen libraries, especially Circuit Playground Express.
### MicroPython v1.19.1 Released
MicroPython v1.19.1 is the current release of MicroPython, it is a bug fix release - [GitHub](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/releases/tag/v1.19.1).
### GitHub Copilot to Become a Paid Service August 23rd
GitHub Copilot will cost USD $10 a month or USD $100 a year starting August 23rd with a free 60 day trial available. GitHub is betting big on AI programming and code in the cloud, according to GitHub CEO [Thomas Dohmke](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/06/22/github-copilot-to-become-a-paid-service-august-23rd-github/#:~:text=GitHub%20CEO%C2%A0Thomas%20Dohmke), who spoke at the [WeAreDevelopers](https://www.wearedevelopers.com/) conference recently


People have flocked to social media, with many upset that their code, with licenses that may not be free and open (or at least require attribution) was used to train Copilot, which does not provide any hint at where the code has come from - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/06/22/github-copilot-to-become-a-paid-service-august-23rd-github/) and [GitHub Blog](https://github.blog/2022-06-21-github-copilot-is-generally-available-to-all-developers/).
### Newsletter Details
The CircuitPython Weekly Newsletter is a CircuitPython community-run newsletter emailed every Tuesday. The complete [archives are here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/). It highlights the latest Python on hardware related news from around the web including CircuitPython, Python and MicroPython developments.

## 23:21 Hug reports
@danh (hosting)
* @tannewt for discussion on how the sdkconfig files for Espressif builds are produced
* Group hug


24:18 (@CGrover text only)
* @JohnPark and @jepler for help with the final merge of the NeoTrellis brightness changes.
* @foamyguy for the weekly Twitch and DeepDive streams. As an experiential learner, seeing “how it’s done” has contributed to many recent ah-ha breakthrough moments.


24:40 @foamyguy 
* Scott and Jeff for reviewing my Palette index validation PR and pointing me toward mp_arg_validate functions.
* @CGrover for sharing a utility to configure and enable grid lines inside of Gimp, very helpful for spritesheets
* Github user @isacben for submitting type information for the Display Shapes library
* @DJDevon3 for sharing an example of outline and shadow effects on a text Label.


25:38 @jepler
* Group hug


25:58 @kattni
* @foamyguy for answering a question about query strings and helping me understand how to chain parameters within one.
* @Mr. Certainly for helping me out with some guide content, and brainstorming page names with me.
* @foamyguy for writing up the code for my upcoming guide
* Welcome back @jepler!
* Group hug!


26:35 @kmatch 
* @PaintYourDragon for sharing their work with the ESP32-S3 LCD peripheral for LED matrices
* @deshipu for guidance on committing changes to submodules inside a circuitpython github fork


27:02 @tammymakesthings
* Group hug!


27:15 @tannewt
* MakerMelissa, deshipu, danh and Foamyguy for brainstorming web workflow things.
* MDN contributors. It is a great resource
* RetiredWizard for doing debug builds and backtraces to find the connect() crash on S3


28:03 @tekktrik (text only)
* Group hug!


## Status Updates
28:21 @danh (hosting)
* Released CircuitPython 7.3.1 last week, with bug fixes and updated frozen libraries.
* Getting CircuitPython to run on ESP32, starting with Adafruit Feather ESP32 V2.


29:28 @CGrover (text only)
* Rather than the CircuitPython-centric approach to color and palette transformation focus of late, I’m starting to look more deeply into how core displayio transfers object palettes and colors into the hardware display buffer, particularly with regard to RGB matrix displays. Given my skill level, it’s looking like a Mines of Moria (Lord of the Rings) adventure.


30:00 @foamyguy
* Last week
   * Testing and review for PyPortal Interface learn guide improvements and a few other smaller PRs
   * Start coding and image asset editing for Game & Watch Octopus game for PyGamer
* This Week
   * Complete Octopus game and work on the Learn guide for it


31:00 @jepler
* Last week:
   * Got home on Wednesday, late
   * Jet lag
   * Caught a cold (negative COVID quick test)
* This week:
   * Trying to get back up to speed
   * Several issues & Pull Requests to get back to work on
   * ~~Look into a problem with cookiecutter~~ Filed some issues related to an incompatibility between requests & chardet that affects the tests of adafruit cookie cutter
   * Enable rgbmatrix for esp32-s3 thanks to new code from PaintYourDragon
   * Help with esp32 port once Dan gets the UART going I can help debug other modules
   * Might check in on QMK support for RP2040, which is in an unmerged PR
   * Still getting over a cold & jet lag


32:52 @kattni
* Last week
   * Spent the entire week and some time over the weekend getting the Create an Excellent GitHub Profile with Markdown guide into moderation. I was able to get to everything I wanted to, and I’m pretty happy with how it turned out. It turned into a beefy guide by the time I was done, but I think it’s worth it. It’s well divided up so folks can choose what they’d like to add and are not required to read the entire guide to find it.
* This week:
   * GitHub Actions Tower Status Light guide
   * Test a new feature in the Adafruit Learn System for the Learn devs
   * Set up Discord AutoMod
   * Look at the PR Tekktrik put together on what needs to be patched on the libs to get them in line with cookiecutter, and decide how to move forward there.
   * Squidge together a couple of templates that are either an update to existing ones, or duplicating the existing ones as a separate template, and updating that.
   * Update the alert on the I2C Addresses guide to suggest making a PR instead of posting to the forum.
   * Update the PM25 Learn guide and GitHub README with some information provided in a GitHub issue.
* Over the weekend:
   * My dad stopped by to sort out what we would need to build the long-desired-but-avoided room in the basement. I had resigned myself to never having it, but once my dad gets involved, it’s pretty much happening. He’s already put together a parts list for it, and as soon as we move everything in the basement into the garage, we’ll be able to get started on it.


34:36 @kmatch
* Made first commit of my ESP32-S3 LCD peripheral code for RGB dot clock displays
* Discovered that ESP pushed some new IDF code updates to the RGB peripheral.  Do these updates solve lingering issues with PSRAM access sharing between CircuitPython and the LCD peripheral?
* This week: think about capturing I2C touchscreen events and improving latency, perhaps a ring buffer in the CP core, like keypad‘s EventQueue?


36:12 @tammymakesthings
* Last week:
   * No Twitch streams because I had 34 work meetings crammed into a 4-day workweek. :-(
   * Worked on my CircuitPython demo for the upcoming DesertPy Python meetup (date TBA)
   * Started designing a useful project for work that grabs CI/CD status from our system (JetBrains TeamCity) via their REST API and displays it on a MatrixPortal I can hang on the wall above my desk.
* This week:
   * Make a decision about whether I change my Twitch “schedule” to “ad hoc when I can” rather than fixed days.
   * Finish the DesertPy demo materials.
   * Work on the MatrixPortal project.
   * Work on my CircuitPython card deck library.


37:44 @tannewt
* Just about to send out PR for web workflow. I think everything is basically working.
* I’m writing docs and will need to run down any build issues too.
* Next step is serial/WebSocket support.


39:16 @tekktrik (text only)
* Last week
   * Explored getting Dependabot working for the libraries, but sadly, there’s a bug regarding defining compatible releases (~= syntax), and would spawn too many PRs right now
   * Got  pyproject.toml working for the BME680 library
* This week
   * Get a list of next steps for a transition from setup.py to pyproject.toml
   * Review PRs that I haven’t had a chance to follow up on
   * Explore remaining library patches that were identified (for the workflow files)
