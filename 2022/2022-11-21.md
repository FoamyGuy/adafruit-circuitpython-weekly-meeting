* Group hug for being an awesome community!


@tannewt
* Liz for hosting the meeting and helping test Glider and PyLeap
* Kattni for helping keep internal meetings organized with Phil and Limor out.


## 17:28 Status Updates
@Liz (BlitzCityDIY) [hosting] 
* First time hosting this meeting
* Working on guides for the NeoPixel BFFs - driver and 5x5 grid
* Personal project - working on a 4 in/4 out CircuitPython quantizer/melody maker for Eurorack. Did some initial breadboarding and coding this week. So far so good


@danh 
* @jepler, @tannewt, and I had an 8.0.0 issue triage meeting.
* Fixed SPI polarity=1 (SPI modes 2 and 3) on RP2040, found while debugging a mode 3 problem on Espressif. I am still investigating the Espressif problem.
* Fixed event channel management on SAMD21. Bug caused errors on soft restart.
* Fixed off-by-one TIMx (timer) reference in STM port, which caused incorrect PWM speeds.
* Reviewed, and sometimes tested, several PR’s.
* Continuing with 8.0.0 issues this week. Maybe I should do another beta.


@DJDevon3
* Last week my circuit python powered Dragon Skull mask made it into an episode of Digikey’s Maker Update. Donald Bell and team made it look pretty epic.
* Updated my 7-segment social media tracker project. Added 2 more segments using a pca9548 multiplexer for a total of 10 backpacks. Unfortunately the backpacks and multiplexers use an identical and conflicting I2C address range of 0x70 to 0x77. Everyone who helped troubleshoot the issue in discord collectively decided that if you’re going to use backpacks with multiplexers you should only use half of the 8 channels. 4 I2C addresses dedicated to multiplexers and 4 addresses dedicated to backpacks. That should still provide a total of 64 backpacks per I2C bus, more than enough for 99.9% of scenarios. I will be submitting a PR to the multiplexer example library specifically for 7-segment backpacks to make providing support for this specific conflict much easier in the future.
* Revised an unfinished project of modding a 16MB flash chip onto an 8MB bluefruit sense. Instead will be going with Adafruit’s new QSPI flash breakout which comes with a 16MB chip and more importantly, an existing nvm.toml definition. The chip wasn’t available when I started the project due to the chip shortage. It’s safer to use an existing known good chip and configuration. Adafruit’s breakout board makes this kind of mod much safer as you can test before soldering the chip onto the board.
* Helped DanH clean up a final beta test for the QT Py S2 wifi scanning bug. Both the Feather ESP32-S2 and QT Py S2 are stable in terms of wifi.
* Designed a Qt Py BFF specifically as a ground pin expander. Will allow more LED’s without having to add a protoboard or perfboard. I need to keep it as small as possible inside the dragon mask.


@foamyguy
* Started on the displayio API changes discussed during previous meeting. Testing it out on 3 types of Display classes EPaper, and FrameBuffer displays in addition to ‘standard’ ones. Continuing to learn and get more comfortable with the different sections of core code.
* Set up a Twitch developer app to test and review the new examples submitted to requests library. Looking into some other information and functionality made available by the Twitch API for integrating with circuitpython
* Working on adapting python library layer to work with proposed new PixelMap in the core


@jepler
* Reminder for those using Mastodon: I’m https://octodon.social/@stylus and I welcome a follow from anyone in this community. I don’t post a lot of CP stuff, I do post a lot of computer-generated images and boost a lot of posts by people who are doing stuff that sounds interesting to me.
* Last week:
* Added support for using the special serial "break" signal to act as KeyboardInterrupt, on all tinyusb devices as well as on the UART of esp32 (depends on support by the USB-serial converter chip as well). This provides a way forward for the problem where when the serial buffer is full, ctrl-c can't be sent to do a keyboard interrupt. We (I) hope that advanced interfaces that use the repl, such as thonny & mu, can learn to use this as an alternative when Ctrl-C isn't working. But we (I) haven't started talking to them or to micropython about it yet.              
* Made draft pull requests for 3 upcoming products, will be finalized when the board designs are finalized. Some changes are expected but in most respects the boards worked well
* Accepted some pull requests, including:  
   * adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_SD: "Fix for occasional write hangs"   
   * adafruit/circuitpython: "Don't block in I2CTarget.request(-1)"   
* Reported some issues, including:  
   * adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_MAX1704x: "reset procedure fails on esp32s3"
* Made pull requests, some of which have been accepted:  
   * adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_NeoPxl8: "Support any number of strands up to 8; make demo more like arduino demo"   
   * adafruit/Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides: "Text scroller example for NeoPixel BFF & QT Py RP2040"   
   * adafruit/circuitpython: "Add minimally tested Adafruit MatrixPortal S2 board def"   
   * adafruit/circuitpython: "Feather esp32 s23 reverse tft"   
   * adafruit/circuitpython: "Allow serial "break" to trigger KeyboardInterrupt"   
   * adafruit/circuitpython: "Interrupt on UART 'break'"   
   * adafruit/circuitpython: "only ignore sdkconfig* files in the espressif port's top directory"   
   * adafruit/circuitpython: "supervisor_start_terminal: don't crash if display is tiny"   
* This week:
   * Going to concentrate on the NeXT keyboard USB HID adapter project for this short week.
   * I don’t have any code written for it yet, it’s at that terrifying “blank screen” stage of development


@kattni
* Last week:
   * Put the Qwiik / STEMMA QT Hub guide into moderation
   * Reviewed Liz’s guides and guide update
   * PiCowbell and STEMMA Hub guides were published
   * Blogged the three recently published guides of mine
   * Added NeoPixel rainbowio_simpletest to the NeoPixel library
   * Fixed up the ESP32 CircuitPython install template per feedback
   * Started the Code of Conduct Update Process document.

@tammymakesthings (text only):
* Last week I worked a bit on figuring out how to add NRPM support to the Adafruit_MIDI library - still researching this. I was out of town for a memorial celebration for a friend, so didn’t get much time to work on CircuitPython this weekend.
* This week:
   * Hoping to move forward with the NRPM stuff for Adafruit_MIDI and to do some PR reviews.
   * Researching the HDMI CEC (Consumer Equipment Control) protocol and designing a Bluetooth-activated “HDMI kill switch”. Also investigating the existing HDMI CEC bridge chips that exist to see if I can find one that can be controlled with I2C rather than implementing the protocol myself.
   * Making a scrolling text Christmas tree ornament for a co-worker who made a lovely laser cut ornament for me!
