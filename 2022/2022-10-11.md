CircuitPython Support for Raspberry Pi Pico W Hits Version 8-beta.1
 CircuitPython Support for Raspberry Pi Pico W 

Work on the CircuitPython support for Raspberry Pi Pico W has reached the point where it has been released on circuitpython.org. While not feature-complete in CircuitPython 8.0.0-beta.1, it is usable for several types of WiFi use. It is currently being actively worked on by Adafruit – circuitpython.org.
Liz posts about trying out WiFi on Pico W – Twitter.

Making a Talking Macintosh with CircuitPython
 Talking Macintosh 

A talking Mac SE! It is set to speak any message it receives using a USB wombat and Adafruit Metro ESP32-S2. It is controlled through Home Assistant using MQTT, using CircuitPython. “My friend set the Mac up to boot to the speech program so it’s going to be part of our tour.” – Discord and GitHub.

@jepler (hosting)
* Anecdata, bill88t & Liz & someone else for picow testing
* Dan and Neradoc and someone else for PR reviews & merging
* Dan for the last release and the next release


@anecdata (lurking)
* @jepler for all the great work getting 🍰🐮 going
* group hug to everyone for all the project inspirations


@danh
* @jepler for the quick work on PicoW WiFi support, and @anecdata for testing.
* @MicroDev1 for reviews and PRs, including quickly fixing a GitHub Actions updating issue.
* @DerBroader71 for finding out a board addition that was held up could be completed, and for testing.
* @jepler for a bunch of touch-up PR’s.
* @bill88t and @anecdata for a lot of testing for the wifi scanning issue.
* @hathach for starting to look at a possible TinyUSB “output treated as input” issue, and to @jepler for another test case for this. Followup: this may be a Linux idiosyncrasy.


19:14 @DJDevon3
* @Jepler for killing it on picow releases
* @DanH & @Anecdata for helping me narrow down suspects in the Feather S2 & S3 hard-reset bug hunt. 
* @Melissa for an excellent tuple update in the Stemma 7-segment display library allowing multiple backpacks to be initialized & combined together as 1 larger backpack.
* @Paul Culter for using his RGB matrix to help me troubleshoot an issue I was having on mine and for going through hand surgery this week.

* @Anne Barela for a beautiful mask project and amazing youtube interview with Alpenglow that represented Adafruit beautifully.
* @skerr & @cater for helping troubleshoot my rfm95 receiver toggling on/off with every save. Turns out I was flipping IRQ off & on every file save, due to incorrect wiring. Now I can continue my efforts on lora projects.

## 22:57 Status Updates
23:30 @jepler (hosting)
* More Pico W progress
* Sleuthing about a serial echo problem, the bug may be a race condition in Linux
* Continuing: Pico W bug chasing, 8.0.0 bug chasing


24:36 @anecdata (lurking)
* Belated hug report for @Neradoc, which may be French for “never sleeps”, for the broad and deep help to everyone on Discord
* used asyncio for the first time to make an ESP32-S2-Feather-TFT-based "𝞵-cronTroller" that regularly checks All. The. Things. on my LAN, plus external servers, at various times and intervals, and sends a push notification if there is something amiss


25:10 @danh
* Fixed a wifi scanning bug by updating ESP-IDF. Still need to test whether this fixes some other WifI bugs.
* Got back about 112 bytes on small builds, but still need more.
* Further fixes on dotenv.
* Added missing native modules to module support matrix.
* Continuing to bug hunt for 8.0.0. Will probably do another 8.0.0 beta soon.


27:39 @DJDevon3
* Received a batch of 20 v1.2 TR-Cowbell PCB’s from JLPCB on Wednesday along with 10 Pico W’s from Digikey. Began testing & assembling some prototypes. Board name in exposed copper layer and my name in Papyrus font. Breakouts for Stemma, I2C, and external display. If the assembly goes well I’m hoping to give some away. Other than as a sequencer it would also make an excellent linear macropad, great for switching cameras & scenes with hotkeys in OBS.
*   * Finished the physical build of Social Media Tracker using 8x 7-segment backpacks & a shadow box, based on a project by Becky Stern. Each display is actually a 2x 4 character display. Thanks to Melissa’s recent PR for the adafruit_ht16k33 library! Now the library combines each pair into a single 8 character display. Currently only integrated a YouTube API. Still have to integrate API’s for Twitter, Github, and something else, maybe Discord or Instagram. Coded with Circuit Python using the wifi & requests libraries. The Feather ESP32-S2 I dropped a solder blob on then fixed using a hot air rework station is the same one now powering the social media tracker box. Resurrected and put back into service. Point of personal pride for my first SMD rework repair. :)
*   * Started working on a neopixel goggle project. Guide says it’s ill-advised to attempt to wear them, well now I have to do it. Will be routing wires and hiding the sides of the LED’s to minimize lighting glare. Should be ok for short durations just to hand out candy.
* Got an RGB Matrix panel running on both an ESP32-S2 & S3 this weekend. The learn guide for the M0/M4/RP2040 Matrix Featherwing does not include code for circuit python and actually mentions the S2 & S3 have yet to be confirmed stable even on Arduino. I confirmed they worked in circuit python and submitted some example code via feedback. The code is identical to example code from adafruit github except on the S2 & S3 they should use the pretty names of RX & TX instead of D1 & D0. Even though I was able to get the RGB Matrix working on Adafruit’s Feather S2 and S3, I was unable to get it working on Unexpected Maker’s FeatherS3. Added a bug report for the UM FeatherS3 & RGB Matrix library. If anyone has a UM FeatherS3 and Matrix panel they can help test with it would be appreciated.
*   * Started working on an eyes project using 2 GC9A01 round displays for a pumpkin window display. @Todbot wrote the GC9A01 examples & library in the community bundle which let me hit the ground running. Submitted a PR to his library with an elif string that will support the M4 Express out of the box.
*   



32:09 @david.glaude (not speaking)
   * CP:
   * Tested @anecdata basic HTTP client code on PicoW
   * Fail: USB-HID, I tried to make the “Meta” LED/Key to work on Windows, but there is no meta key no LED so I will keep playing with ScrollLock
   * Replaced my mouse jiggler by simulating randomly blinking of the ScrollLock LED
   * (last week, already in newsletter) “pAssIVe AGRessiVE WRitING” helper by random shift keypress: https://twitter.com/DavidGlaude/status/1574875035533197312?s=20&t=hERG0jztt5msS1dUp1gYEw 
   * Non CP:
   * Success: Upgraded my Casio F-91W with Sensor Watch ( https://www.sensorwatch.net/ )
   * Fail: to reproduce the HID Remapper (two pico back to back) = read USB mouse/keyboard and pretend to be a mouse/keyboard: https://github.com/jfedor2/hid-remapper/blob/master/HARDWARE.md


33:03 @foamyguy (not present)
   * Investigated issue with BitmapLabel under Blinka_DisplayIO and submit a PR to allow it to work again. The change needed was implementing Bitmap.blit() function in Blinka_DisplayIO
   * Library PR Reviews and testing
   * Testing MQTT PR that has more standardized and predictable behavior when there are multiple messages in the message queue. Tried out the new version with example scripts and Learn Guide projects on various different devices.
   * Basic HTTP request testing on Pico W. Built a simple terminal based trivia game.


33:43 @makermelissa
   * Last Week:
   * Went into a fairly deep rabbithole of seeing what worked and what didn’t with regards to running Picamera2 on Bullseye in various configurations.
   * Updated the rpi-vision app to work with Picamera2
   * Added missing boards to circuitpython.org
   * Updated the 128x64 OLED FeatherWing guide with a page on how to wire it properly to non-feather microcontrollers.
   * This Week:
   * Working on updating the TensorFlow on Raspberry Pi guide for Bullseye
   * Probably a few more GitHub PRs
   * Get back to finishing up code.circuitpython.org


34:35 @tekktrik (text only / not present)
   * Last week
   * Not much for CircuitPython other than staying on top of PR reviews, since I’m moving over the next couple weeks
   * This week
   * Still moving so just trying to keep up with Hacktoberfest PRs, or at least the ones that don’t need hardware that I’ve already packed!
   * In personal news, the CircuitPythonukiah is most of the way through 8 day test, which means once the move is done, it’s time to make a lot of them!
   * The tooling behind the project has been fun, and I may break it off into smaller tools and make them public since they may be useful to others
   * Relatedly, started a mini project brought up by @danh to have a tool that automatically saves code in a local directory to a CircuitPython board.  Having fun using os.fork(), can’t wait to accidentally put it in a while True loop.
