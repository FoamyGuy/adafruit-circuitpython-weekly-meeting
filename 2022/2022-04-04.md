## Community News


### Two New CircuitPython Releases
Two new versions of CircuitPython came out last week - [CircuitPython 7.2.4](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/03/31/circuitpython-7-2-4-released/) and [CircuitPython 7.3.0-beta.0](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/03/31/circuitpython-7-3-0-beta-0-released/).
Notable changes to 7.3.0 since 7.2.4:
* Experimental mDNS support.
* USB to Serial/JTAG support for REPL on appropriate boards.
* Initial experimental USB host support.
* Merge MicroPython 1.18 changes.
Notable fixes to 7.2.4 since 7.2.3:
* Enable I2C power by default on Feather ESP32-S2.
* Fix supervisor.reload().
### Raspberry Pi Founder Discusses Shortages
Eben Upton released an update discussing the supply issues for Raspberry Pi single board computers (SBC) which include the Raspberry Pi 4 and the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W - [Raspberry Pi News](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/production-and-supply-chain-update/).
"Over the last six months we’ve been working hard to get more Raspberry Pi products built and shipped to customers. Despite a variety of supply-chain challenges, we’ve consistently been able to build around half a million of our single-board computers and Compute Module products each month."
"As we’ve said before, the current situation is as much a demand shock as a supply shock: demand for Raspberry Pi products increased sharply from the start of 2021 onwards, and supply constraints have prevented us from flexing up to meet this demand, with the result that we now have significant order backlogs for almost all products. Many Approved Resellers have implemented single-unit limits to combat this, with Adafruit and others going further and enforcing two-factor authentication – we’re encouraging other Approved Resellers to consider this route. So, what should you do if you need to buy a Raspberry Pi in 2022?Always buy from an Approved Reseller."
### Adafruit IO is now storing over 1 billion data records
Adafruit IO has reached a milestone in that it now stores over 1 billion data records.
The interesting part about this is that due to how free accounts work, most of that data rolls over after 30 days and is deleted.
TOTAL DATA RECORDS 1 Billion (1003060059)
Adafruit continues to grow the infrastructure behind IO to support their free and paid users. They’re adding new features and are looking forward to new users discovering the product.
In the last month, Adafruit has added new dashboard blocks, updated Actions, had major updates to Wippersnapper (with more on the way) and they have more updates planned - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/04/01/adafruit-io-is-now-storing-over-1-billion-data-records/).
And read more on new features to IO Actions - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/03/31/adafruit-io-new-actions-features/).
### Compose with Markdown in Google Docs on web
In Google Docs, you can now select “Automatically detect Markdown” from Tools > Preferences to enable auto correcting for Markdown syntax, a lightweight markup language for applying formatting using plain text - [Google](http://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2022/03/compose-with-markdown-in-google-docs-on.html) and [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/03/31/compose-with-markdown-in-google-docs-on-web-google/).
Currently, Google Docs supports some Markdown syntax, such as:
* or – followed by a space autocorrects to bullet points
Various ways to start a numbered list similar to Markdown
[] followed by a space autocorrects to checkboxes
The expanded support will now support autocorrection for:
* Headings
* Italic and bold
* Bold + italic
* Strikethrough
* Links

Library updates in the last seven days:
**New Libraries**
 * [Adafruit_CircuitPython_TSC2007](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_TSC2007)
**Updated Libraries**
Too many to list today! Please see the [CircuitPython Library report](https://adafruit-circuit-python.s3.amazonaws.com/adabot/bin/reports/circuitpython_library_report_20220404.txt) if you’re interested in the list.


Overall: We’re working on the library infrastructure in each of the libraries to ensure that everything that should be the same across the libraries ends up the same. There are three PRs in play that involve this set of updates - but there will be a lot more work put into it to get all the libraries up to date. We’ll discuss all of this later and In the Weeds.

## 23:50 Status Updates
24:18 @danh
* Released CIrcuitPython 7.2.4 to support the new version of Adafruit Feather ESP32-S2, and CircuitPython 7.3.0-beta.0 to have a “latest” for people to try.
* Still working on a fix for a `board.UART()` problem on RP2040 boards. I have a fix but there is still an odd problem when connecting UART pins to another unpowered board.
* WIll be working on ESP32SPI issues and other bugs.


26:04 @CGrover (text only)
* Finished the multi-cat version of @foamyguy’s Neko Cat project. It’s compatible with PyPortals and TFT FeatherWings. The final version will become two gifts using 2.4” TFT FeatherWings and pink RP2040 Feathers. The challenge now is to install it in an appropriately creative enclosure. Suggestions are welcomed (except for anything looking like a litter box).
* When testing projects on the PyPortal Titano, I noticed that the display brightness range wasn’t similar to other PyPortals and TFT FeatherWing displays. The Titano’s display brightness PWM signal is operating at a frequency (50kHz?), too high for the FAN5333 backlight controller. The datasheet notes that a frequency above 1kHz may cause a brightness nonlinearity. Tests on the 3.5” TFT FeatherWing (same display, same backlight controller) confirmed that a PWM frequency of 500Hz works the best and restores the entire brightness range. Will submit an issue for displayio.display for further testing.  Ref:  https://github.com/CedarGroveStudios/Cat/issues/1


27:42 @foamyguy
* Catching up on PR reviews after a few weeks of less time to dedicate in the evenings due to teaching web development. Class has concluded and am getting back to a more usual schedule.
* Made an attempt at adding hidden functionality to vectorio shapes. Got it partially working but needs some additional work still.
* Worked on extending the PageLayout that I built last week to be used in a TabLayout class that allows user to easily created tabbed pages with labels for each page and eventually touch interaction to change between them
* Planning and implementing a “bitmap patch loader” that will use a small spritesheet and some configuration information to create arbitrarily sized TileGrids from the sprite sheet by repeating the middle tiles as needed to achieve the desired size. This will allow us to keep asset size minimal but still be able to build “panels'' of arbitrary sizes that look nice at runtime. First planned usage is the tabs on the TabLayout but I can think of a few others as well.
* Update neko kitty guide project code to new multi-cat version
* Look into adabot further to try to figure out how to make a [Draft] indicator on the circuitpython.org/contributing page.


30:43 @jepler
* Last week (I think?): fixed samd51 “every 3 days” rtc bug. Still needs to be merged?
* This week: Already made good progress on several issues assigned to me in the core


31:23 @jerryn
* Did some testing of the esp32c3 build  - here are some notes in case anyone else tries it.
   * Used modified rshell (to accept binascii) and screen to test
   * Esp32c3-devkit worked fine – rshell, REPL and wifi-test worked
   * Qtpy esp32c3 did not work
      * Rshell was unable to connect
      * With Screen, able to connect to REPL, but it is dropping characters
         * cut/paste of commands was unreliable.
         * This is causing rshell issues as well.
      * Import wifi causes the qtpy esp32c3 to hang – requires power cycle to recover
      * Opened issues in CP repository. One for REPL, one for wifi.
      * Curious if anyone else has tried the qtpy esp32c3?
   * qtpy-espc2c3 works with Micropython v1.18 esp32c3-usb build.


34:50 @kattni
* Last week:
   * I ran my first Adabot patch on my own. Took a bit to get through, but once we got through the bumpy bits, it went really well, applied to all the libraries, and fixed a major issue caused by a dependency to one of our CI files causing everything to fail.
   * Got through a huge amount of miscellaneous that had been piling up for a bit here. Was mostly little things, but it was adding up quickly.
   * Added a MicroPython Setup page to the Feather ESP32 V2 guide.
   * Met with Professor John Gallaugher to talk about his experiences with CircuitPython in education for a talk I submitted to the Education Summit (which is a small get-together before PyCon about Python in Education). It hasn’t been accepted, but I didn’t want to wait until the last minute to find out it was. If it’s not, I’ll have at least part of a talk put together!
   * Wrote up an example of using a button to control two NeoPixel rings using asyncio for the asyncio template.
   * Mostly finished the asyncio template, after a lot of help (Thanks again Dan and Mark)
   * Ran into issues with testing PyLeap, so will be looking into that this week.
   * Liz finished her first product guide! (late on Friday, so I’ll proof it this week)
* This week:
   * Proof Liz’s guide so she can get it in moderation.
   * Blog the Feather V2 MicroPython Setup guide update
   * Look into why the PyLeap testing isn’t working properly - DONE.
   * Get PyLeap going on my iPad
   * Get the GIFs for the asyncio template, upload them to GitHub, and add the template area for including them in the guide page.
   * Write up the guide for the QT Py lipo BFF
   * Verify the cookiecutter and patch PRs put together by Tekktrik
   * Go through the .gitignore PR put together by Tekktrik
   * Begin thinking about more projects to add to PyLeap - porting existing ones, or coming up with new ones.


38:24 @kmatch
* Created the files for a DotClockDisplay FrameBuffer RGB display peripheral module for the ESP32-S3 and got it to build. 
* Thanks to the team’s help, figured out how to allocate the framebuffer into PSRAM. Drew first pixels on the screen using hard coding in the constructor function. 
* This week: Get DotClockDisplay to draw pixels using the CircuitPython code. Hope to show the REPL this week. 


39:24 @makermelissa:
* Last Week:
   * Finished up the 1.47” and 1.9” Display guides
   * Updated the Raspberry Pi 4 Tensorflow guide to work
   * Fixed Blinka to work with older and newer versions of libgpiod
   * Tested out the ESP32-C3 QT Py on ESPTool
   * Recorded a Podcast on the CircuitPython show
   * Added a bunch of new boards to CircuitPython.org
   * Spoke with Nabucasa about maintaining future updates on WebSerial ESPTool
* This Week:
   * Working on updating guides to point to NabuCasa version of WebSerial ESPTool
   * Taking a look at a possible improved Raspberry Pi Display driver
   * Seeing what it will take to point the WipperSnapper Firmware Updater to point to the NPM package for WebSerial ESPTool


40:35 @mark(gamblor) [ lurking ] 
* Submitted the revised zlib PR. Once it is acceptable I can create an issue to track the possible improvements discussed in the current PR so they are documented and if someone else wants to grab them they can.
* Off on vacation Saturday for a few days to NYC, getting to try again for the vacation I had to cancel almost exactly this date in 2020. If anyone from the community is in NYC or around and wants to meet up for coffee let me know on discord.


41:15 @tammymakesthings (missing meeting)
* Last Week
   * 2 [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/tammymakesthings) streams last week - finished up (for now) my MacroPad MIDI project, and began the implementation of a CircuitPython library to represent decks of cards (with displayio support)
   * Began work on a fix for @mraleson’s piku tool to work properly with boards that have large flash capacity
* This week
   * Planned Twitch streams Wednesday at 5:30PM PT and Sunday at 9:00am PT (schedule subject to change). I’m planning to continue work on my CircuitPython card deck library.
   * Continuing to work on the piku fixes
   * Super busy with work this week (last week in my current job) so likely time-constrained again this week. 


42:18 @tekktrik
* This week
   * Worked on the proposed patch and cookiecutter update
   * Added more functionality to the Tic stepper motor library
   * Went through some PRs and issues to try and reduce the number of them
   * Added some more type annotations and typing infrastructure like Protocols to make some more complicated libraries easier to work on in the future
   * Updates to a few libraries I noticed had missing dependencies
   * Registered for my first grad course - it’s on microcontrollers and embedded systems, so thanks for the inspiration!
* Next week
   * Continuing to work on the patch and cookiecutter update
   * Likely continuing on adding more to the Tic library
   * Follow-up on some feedback on recent PRs to libraries like PortalBase
   * Planning for PyCon!
## 44:30 In The Weeds
@kattni & @tekktrik
* I asked Tekktrik to compare the CI-type files, including .gitignore, across all of the libraries, as there are files that should be identical, and it has become pretty clear they are not. As well, we haven’t been great about updating cookiecutter with all of the changes we’ve made to the libraries, so the newer libraries are missing out on some important updates. To that end, Tekktrik put together three PRs. All can be discussed, but I think the one that should involve the most discussion is the .gitignore file.
* https://github.com/adafruit/cookiecutter-adafruit-circuitpython/pull/178 
   * When it was determined that there were significant differences across the libraries in the .gitignore file, I asked Tekktrik to pull together from all libs every entry in all of the .gitignore files. This turned out to be much bigger than expected, and is almost certainly worth some discussion. As well, I’d like to see it better organised with comments as headers, but neither Tekktrik or I know enough about what’s going on with some of the entries to do a solid job of organising. If anyone is up for that, please let us know.
* https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_TSC2007/pull/2
   * This PR represents everything that needs to be added to cookiecutter to get it up to date with all of the updates and patches we’ve applied to the libraries over the last x-amount of time. Not sure there’s a whole lot to discuss here, but if anyone is familiar with it, please take a look and let us know if we missed anything.
* https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_BME680/pull/48
   * The changes in this PR represent everything that will need to be patched across the libraries to get them all in line with the desired workflow. Again, there’s not much to discuss here, but if anyone is familiar with it, please take a look and let us know if any changes are necessary.
## 1:01:30 Wrap-Up
Next week’s meeting: April 11 at the usual time, 2PM ET/11AM PT
