## 20:35 Status Updates


21:21 @danh (hosting)
* Light week due to Thanksgiving.
* Fixed wifi.radio.connect() and .start_ap() signatures, both in documentation and in arg validation code.
* SAMDx5x: fixed playing mono files when stereo output is requested.
* Will continue on 8.0.0 issues this week.
* May make another beta this week.


22:50 @DJDevon3
* Successfully modified the Adafruit step switch into an RGB step switch. It’s a hacky modification., not a drop-in replacement. A soldering iron and dremel (or sandpaper) are required to make the 4-pin LED fit into the housing. This now offers a way for anyone doing a project with step switches to make them RGB if they really want to. I have a 10 minute video on my youtube channel that shows the entire modification process start to finish.
* I have to make yet another new revision of my TR-Cowbell sequencer board to add new holes and pca multiplexer chips to accept the 4-pin RGB LED’s. The step switch breakout boards from Adafruit only accommodate holes for 2-pin LED’s so they might want to update their next board revision to accept RGB’s for those who might want to do the modification.
* Finished up the cyber ski goggles from proof of concept to reality. Used a Qt Py S2 and 350mah battery.
* Went on Show & Tell last Wednesday and showed off both projects this week with a link to the circuit python Github code powering them.
* Started working on a requests API for Instagram only to find out a Facebook developer account is required and I decided against it. If anyone wants a Facebook or Instagram API there are now plenty of request API examples to create one, I’ve decided not to be the one to do it. Instead the next API I plan to tackle is Octopart.
* Switched Mastodon servers this week. You can find me at TreasureDev@Hackaday.social


25:38 @foamyguy
* Last week
   * Working on making root_group settable to change the display API. Mostly working on behavior around setting to None. Ran into a Hard Fault with my first attempt and tried a few ways to debug it. I don’t do core crash debugging enough to be familiar with the process so it took a bit to get everything set up and figure out how to get relevant output. Ended up getting it resolved after getting backtrace from the debug pin and using the parse script in the core repo
   * While attempting to debug the above issue found a seemingly unrelated issue resulting in a Hard Fault on Metro M4 device specifically with DEBUG=1 build only.
   * Working on core PixelMap PR, spent some time figuring out how to revert back to good code after bungling a merge from main to update. Then adjusting the Python layer make use of new core PixelMap class and testing the existing examples with it.
* This week
   * Got the displayio API change working correctly (I think!) in all scenarios. Made a tester script that runs through each possibility and reports when they occur and if things are set appropriately afterward
   * Hoping to finish PixelMap effort, bring in the slicing getter from Mark, and move the python code to a new home if we decide to go that route.
   * Testing httpserver library and updating learn guide code to use new import syntax for it.


29:20 @jepler
* Last week:
   * Short week due to holiday
   * Started & completed code for the NeXT keyboard
   * Printed & built the parts for a holiday collab with N+P, need to place the LED strips next
* This week:
   * CircuitPython core bugs as assigned
   * Complete guide text for the NeXT keyboard
   * Write code for the holiday collab
   * If you’re waiting on me for something, please ping again.


30:44 @kattni
* Last week:
   * Super short.
   * Met with Liz to discuss the code she sent me for my upcoming project guides, to get a better understanding of it and suggest changes.
   * Liz made changes and sent the updated code back to me.
   * Went through updated code and started fixing up a couple of things like formatting and comments.
* This week:
   * Get caught up.
   * Meet with Tekktrik about an Adabot PR in progress
   * File an issue on the Adafruit IO library about IP-based time not working properly.
   * Finish cleaning up the project code and get it back to Liz
   * Begin the Holiday Countdown Display project, work on it through the end of the week.
* Personal:
   * I wrote up a Feather version of the previously-Pi receiver for my LoRa Mailbox Notifier. I didn’t write the original Pi code, so I had no idea how to modify it to add in Adafruit IO code. As well, the Pi was overkill from the beginning, but the Feathers with built-in TFTs hadn’t been released yet, so the Pi with LoRa bonnet including display made the most sense.
      * This version uses the status NeoPixel for a status LED instead of a bare LED, displays info on the built-in TFT, sends the mailbox and battery data to Adafruit IO, which sends you an email when the mailbox door is opened.
      * The NeoPixel is nestled between two taller components on the Feather ESP32-S2 TFT, so I hot glued a small chunk of a tube of hot glue over the NeoPixel, and not only is it pretty solidly on there, it worked like a charm. Essentially adding a small light pipe, but short enough that it was about the same size as the chonky bare LED I had soldered to the Pi.
      * I made a number of attempts to somehow make the boot button easier to press. (It’s a rather tiny button, and rather close to the reset button.) None of the methods I tried worked, but worth noting all of them involved hot glue. Hot glue is difficult to apply precisely (or at least it is with my hot glue gun), so inevitably it blobbed everywhere, and the button would stop working. One time I managed to make a tiny dot of it, but that method didn’t stay on the board for more than a minute (connection that small was weak with hot glue).
      * It’s more compact than the Pi (obviously), and in the event of issues, will be much easier to troubleshoot.
   * I realised two days later that I had not copied the code off of the Feather after making further edits, meaning I did not have a current copy of it. My dad’s not exactly tech savvy, but I walked him through plugging the Feather into his computer, finding CIRCUITPY, copying code.py to his desktop, and emailing it to me. It took 4 minutes over the phone, and worked perfectly. Mentioning this as a nod to what we’ve made here.
   * I still want to clean up the sender code, and then update the receiver code to match, and update both the next time I visit my folks after completing the changes. (Which is half the reason I needed the current receiver code.)
   * The other half of the reason is I can update my GitHub repo with the Feather version. I lucked into two Pi 0 Ws from a coworker for the original project. For most folks, they’re basically unobtainium for now. So it will be nice to have a more readily available version posted as well.
   * Finally, I ordered some super glue to try again to add something to the top of the button to make it a bit simpler to press. We’ll see if my idea works or not.


34:30 @MakerMelissa
* Last Week:
   * Worked on code.circuitpython.org and fixed some bugs related to Web Workflow
   * Currently redoing the USB workflow using some functions that work more like the other workflows
* This Week:
   * Add some new Blinka boards to circuitpython.org and hopefully get to 100 boards
   * Continue working on code.circuitpython.org
   * Maybe work on improving the BLE workflow next


35:10 @Paul Cutler
* New episode of The CircuitPython show is out today with Mark Komus.  We chat about Mark’s start, the Monster Eyes project, and contributing to the CircuitPython core.


35:30 @tannewt
* Getting back into the swing of reviews and issues.
* PR out for adding web workflow to Pico W without MDNS.

Should the python layer of PixelMap class move into a new library Adafruit_CircuitPython_PixelMap to be imported as adafruit_pixelmap. Or should it stay in its current home inside of the led_animation library?
