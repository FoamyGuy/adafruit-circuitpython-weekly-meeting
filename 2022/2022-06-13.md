### 3:14 CircuitPython 8.0.0 alpha 1 released!
The CircuitPython team has released CircuitPython 8.0.0-alpha.1, an alpha version for 8.0.0. It is relatively stable, but there will be further additions and fixes before final release. Note that major number changes, such as version 7 to version 8, may have application programming interface (API) changes that are incompatible with the previous major version - [GitHub](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases/tag/8.0.0-alpha.1).


Notable changes to 8.0.0 since 7.3.0:
- Added `TileGrid.contains()`.
- `AnalogIn` values are full range from 0 to 65535, instead of having zeros on low-order bits.
- `OneWire` is only in `onewireio`, and is no longer in `busio` or `bitbangio`.
- `gamepadshift` has been removed: use `keypad.ShiftRegisterKeys` instead.
- `dotenv` support: `os.getenv()` values can be set in the `.env` file.

### 8:42 Python 3.11 Speedup Benchmarks
Last month Python 3.11 Beta 1 was released as their first preview of this major update to the Python programming language. Besides new language features and other improvements, Python 3.11 performance is looking fantastic with very nice performance uplift over prior Python 3 releases. Besides changes affecting the Python language itself, Python 3.11 has been landing performance work from the ‚ÄúFaster CPython Project‚Äù to speed-up the reference implementation. Python 3.11 is 10~60% faster than Python 3.10 according to the official figures and a 1.22x speed-up with their standard benchmark suite - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/06/08/python-3-11-performance-benchmarks-are-looking-fantastic-python-phoronix/) and [Phoronix](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=python-311-benchmarks&num=1).
### 9:36 Newsletter Details

## 21:56 Status Updates
22:14 @tannewt (host)
* Merged in translation changes (did I say that last week?)
* Just about ready with auto-wifi changes. Its behavior depends on .env so it should be backwards compatible.
* That change also includes terminalio support for a title bar and changes to the default displayio group that adds a titlebar tilegrid.
* Running into code size issues that I‚Äôll need to resolve first.
* Next up is getting the basic http server going. Looks like we‚Äôll need to poll the sockets in the background.


24:40 @CGrover (text only) 
* Made progress with the displayio-based RGB matrix brightness/gamma class. It works nicely for pre-defined displayio objects such as bitmap palettes, labels, and shapes. Still running into issues trying to get the class to autonomously discover objects by walking the displayio.Group tree. 
* Also found that creating a modifiable displayio.Palette class object through inheritance is problematic; not all of the needed __base__ methods are revealed after instantiation. A head-scratcher, particularly given my skill level.
* Will continue work on 1) gaining a better understanding of displayio.Group tree attributes and 2) defining and describing the palette type inheritance behavior. Even if the answers are not found, there are acceptable workarounds. The current version of the matrix brightness tool/process could become very useful.


25:43 @danh
* Released CircuitPython 8.0.0-alpha.1.
* Debugging ESP32SPI problems, particularly on MatrixPortal. Seeing this as at least two different problems: one related to RGBMatrix, and another related to some AirLift problem unrelated to displays.


27:03 @dexter (lurking)
* Working with Blinka on Pi Zero W, 1.3‚Äù TFT Joystick Bonnet
* Trying out 8.0.0 and MDNS on the FunHouse


27:19 @foamyguy
* Last week
   * Updated circup for 8.x builds of circuitpython
   * Started creating example code scripts illustrating the functionalities of bitmaptools. So far I‚Äôve got scaling and rotating manipulation examples. Updating documentation where it makes sense to make it easier for folks to use
   * Created a ‚ÄúReaction Speed Test‚Äù game with a FunHouse and a strip of neopixels that bounces a light back and forth and the player presses a button to try to stop the light in the middle stopping zone. Took this to an Art Faire event over the weekend and several people played and enjoyed. Talked with a few of the kids who played the most about potential improvements
* This Week
   * More bitmaptools examples
   * Itertools library refactoring
   * Testing out some specific typing annotations proposed for the MPR121 library to ensure mpy-cross and microcontrollers can handle them
   * Start working on removing older CP 6 compatibility code for OnDiskBitmap in Learn guide code


29:44 @kattni
* Last week:
   * Published QT Py Pico guide
   * Started the GitHub Profile guide
* So far today:
   * Create repository to house the I2C device address list, add one example to show what we‚Äôre expecting for the project.
* This week:
   * Provide the info to folks interested in helping with the I2C project.
   * Hopefully finish GitHub Profile guide
   * GitHub Actions status tower light guide.
* Otherwise:
   * Lost Friday to taking my cat to the vet, bloodwork came back significantly improved from last time, turns out she‚Äôs very dehydrated and now needs sub-q fluids daily.
   * Went to Motor City Pride.
   * Got the mailbox project working again, but I need to rewire a reed switch the opposite direction from the current one for it to be working ‚Äúproperly‚Äù. Will be scrambling this week to make the code do what I want it to now that I have the base code working. I will definitely have help.
   * My talk was accepted to PyOhio, so once I get through the mailbox project, I‚Äôll begin prep on that. Recording is due 17 July, iirc, so I have a bit of time, but I‚Äôm also really, really, really good at leaving literally everything to the last minute.


32:17 @makermelissa
* Last week:
   * Worked on the STMPE kernel driver on Raspberry Pi and am making some progress
   * Tested out TSC2007 touch screen drivers some more and found my hardware wasn‚Äôt passing basic tests. Possibly my touch screen was damaged in storage. I have more hardware now and it‚Äôs not working correctly.
* This week:
   * Short week for me and I‚Äôll be out the next couple of weeks for foot surgery and recovery.
   * Continuing working on Touch screen stuff
   * Go through any guide feedback
   * If time, I may turn to looking at HT16K33 issues


33:19 @tammymakesthings
* Last week:
   * Didn‚Äôt stream because of a combination of work issues and a recurring Internet outage in my neighborhood. (Thankfully, I have a new Internet provider now!)
   * Figured out how I need to fix the graphic rendering tests I did for the Card Deck library, so I can do that next time I stream
   * Attended the DesertPy Python meetup and sang the praises of CircuitPython
* This week:
   * Get back to streaming now that my Internet issues have been addressed, and adjust my streaming schedule.
   * Continue work on the CircuitPython card deck library‚Äôs graphics rendering components.
* Future:
   * I‚Äôve been invited to give a demo of CircuitPython at the next DesertPy meetup in early July, so I need to start working on what that looks like.


35:48 @tekktrik
* Last week:
   * Added the new adabot scripts to the repository, and made them all platform, tool independent scripts (thanks PyGithub and GitPython!)
   * Fixed libraries affected by the adafruit_logging update
   * Began working on removing gamepadshift from one of the Learn Guide examples
   * Continued working on implementing image transfer for the Bluefruit Connect library
* This week
   * Hopefully finalize the image transfer update
   * Burning down some of the issues on Github I‚Äôve opened


## 37:56 In The Weeds
38:18 Mark(gamblor21) [I will try to be here for this work dependant]
I was playing with my GPS module this weekend and realized it would be a good candidate for asyncio. Had a brief discussion on discord this morning with @tannewt about how this would look. I‚Äôm unsure if any libraries have asyncio support yet.


The basic idea is to create a second library (e.g. adafruit_gps_asyncio) that could wrap the primary library and provide the asyncio support.


My assumption would be they could co-exist in the same mpy file and repo.


Looking for any thoughts and comments.


44:50 @tannewt - ESP32 support


## 51:57 Wrap-Up

Next meeting is Tuesday June 21st. *NOT* Monday as stated in wrap-up.
