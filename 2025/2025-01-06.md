## 12:46 Hug reports

13:25 @tannewt (host)

* @Paul Cutler for restarting the CircuitPython Show\!  
* @jepler, @FoamyGuy, @relic-se, Sam Blenny and Andrew Smith for CircuitPython2025 posts.  
* @FoamyGuy for deep diving over the holidays.

14:00 @anecdata (text only)

* @jepler for so many contributions and assistance over the years, especially numerous networking features and fixes, including the MBEDTLS memory fix this week  
* @eightycc for the deep dive into integrating raspberrypi RM2 wifi  
* @neradoc and @danh for CircuitPython help on Discord, to me and to many others

14:27 @CGrover (text only)

* To @jepler for numerous impactful contributions to the CircuitPython community. We all have benefitted from the innovative and detailed designs from core to drivers to fully-realized devices accompanied with those detailed learning guides. Jeff, you provided inspiration and many useful examples for me in my understanding and application of software development techniques, particularly for my breakthrough understanding of ulab and uDecimal – and synthio\! Thank you and best wishes for your journey’s next chapter.  
* Historical hugs to Tony DiCola and Jerry Needell for pioneering leadership on Micropython (Tony) and ground-breaking CircuitPython drivers for the RFM boards (Jerry).  
* Inspirational open-source hugs to Tyeth and Brent for practical and easy-to-use AIO CircuitPython UI and example code, particularly for managing feed throttle limits for multiple autonomous devices.  
* A Web API hug to DJDevon for running the gauntlet and providing numerous solution examples that look at reliability issues from many angles.  
* To @PaulCutler for the invitation to discuss the weather station project on The CircuitPython Show podcast. And an “editing excellence” hug for his skill at making me sound coherent.

15:47 @danh

* @PaulCutler for inviting me to be on the CircuitPython show. We recorded an episode about building CircuitPython.  
* @jepler for working on PIO for higher-numbered pins on RP2350  
* @tannewt for updating to ESP-IDF 5.3.2.  
* @anecdata, @RetiredWizard, @MichalPokusa for HTTPServer work. @eightycc for core work.

16:53 @foamyguy

* User theSW_Fink on the Adafruit forums who posted a bunch of small sized BDF fonts a while ago [https://forums.adafruit.com/viewtopic.php?t=203655](https://forums.adafruit.com/viewtopic.php?t=203655)  
* Belated hug to todbot for sharing circuitpython UDP networking examples on gist  
* @slaftos on github for submitting a PR to adabot that codifies the behavior of warning / report on naming of example files within subdirectories.  
* Group Hug

18:09 @jepler

* Group hug  
* Hug for Paul Corner’s circuitpython show podcast & for inviting me. (I think I said this before the holidays but I don’t mind repeating myself)  
* Hug for cooper & mark (gamblor) for continued audio work. Please ping me when I need to do more review  
* Hug for dan for testing more than one thing on the pio PR. Now I’ll test more before asking for fresh reviews.  
* Hug for scott, juggling work & life  
* Hug to jposada202020 for gracefully choosing to withdraw several unmaintained libraries from the bundle. Knowing when to say “no” or “I’m done” is important, and sometimes giving yourself permission to say it is hard.

19:48 @michalpokusa (text only)

* @anecdata for extensive testing PR that added HTTPS to adafruit_httpserver and @danh for merging it  
* Group hug, happy New Year everyone

20:04 @Paul Cutler

* Hugs for everyone that responded to being a guest on The CircuitPython Show, the response was fantastic.

20:18 Tyeth Gundry (missing meeting?)

* Big hug for Dan, monitoring the wippersnapper/adafruitIO discord, and submitting a wicked fix for the mqtt library to no longer ignore socket response codes (allowing packet retries and sending remaining data from truncated payloads). This went unnoticed on esp32 but drastically affected Pico W/2W when sending large image (base64) payloads.

## 20:47 Status Updates

21:00 @tannewt (host)

* Blogging CircuitPython2025 posts and doing my own this week.  
* Working on Zephyr port. Adding pins, board and DigitalInOut.  
* Hobby: Playing with Meshtastic.

23:48 @CGrover (text only)

* Testing the “final” version of the combined Weather/Corrosion Monitor LCARS display as the weather architecture project comes to a completion. The display’s ESP32-S3 CircuitPython code also doubles as the AIO+ weather data source repeater with just a few minor changes. The new devices (as well as the original PyPortal M4 versions) will be featured in a Playground Note that should be published sometime this week.  
* Work is progressing on the Portal FeatherWing-Wing PCB designed to add PyPortal hardware peripherals to the back of the 3.5-inch Cap Touch TFT display. Hoping to get the prototype’s PCB order sent to OSH Park by early next week.  
* Nostalgically retired the first two versions of the workstation corrosion monitor devices. The enclosures were disassembled and put back into the inventory for repurposing.

24:48 @danh

* CircuitMatter: got further running on CircuitPython.  
  * Made some changes to core CircuitPython to fix a couple of CPython incompatibilities.  
  *  In the key generation phase there is something that’s recommended to be run at least 10-100k times for cryptographic security, which is completely impractical in CircuitPython (would take \>3 hours). Temporarily reduced that to move forward. It may make sense to do key generation to be done on a host computer, and then move the keys over for use on CircuitPython.  
* Fixed a bug in MiniMQTT library that caused large packets to be truncated. That broke ESP32SPI, because its Socket.send() doesn’t return a count, so fixed that too.

26:36 @foamyguy

* Fixes for circup / wwshell file utility  
* Automate Community bundle library list file. Add code of conduct to repo, and section to readme  
* Practice C, Arduino, and GDB  
* Library issues and  PR review  
  * VL6180X min 20ms for continuous read  
  * VL53L4CD implement suggestions to support non-longint builds  
  * PCF8574 return bool type from value property  
  * VEML770 test autolux and displayio example PRs  
  * WS2801 Test on Pi. Start refactoring to use pixelbuf  
* Project from the break was a tile based game about mining resources and crafting jewelry and other items

30:20 @jepler

* Leaving Adafruit at the end of March – for more details, you can check out my CircuitPython 2025 post. https://blog.adafruit.com/2025/01/01/circuitpython2025/  
* Successfully took time off, barely touched CircuitPython  
* Did some cool 3d printing stuff, will probably show it on show & tell this wednesday so tune in.  
* This week:  
  * Fixing bugs I introduced in the RP2350 PIO PR, once I track them down  
  * Then back to rgbmatrix stuff on pi5. Ultimate goal is to wrap it for use from Python/Blinka.

31:46 @Paul Cutler

* New episode of The Bootloader is out today and the new season of The CircuitPython Show will kick off next Monday, Jan 13th with Adafruit community member Aaron Pendley aka squid.jpg.

## 32:17 In The Weeds

@michalpokusa (text only)  
I would like to ask about the possibility of expanding the supported “re” module functionality. Would it be possible to “copy” the CPython’s implementation in order to add support for e.g. named capture groups, counted repetitions, and/or lookaheads/lookbehinds etc.  
In my head, it does come only to adapting CPython code to the rest of CircuitPython, not developing it from scratch.

What is the opinion of the CP team about it? Could it be a planned feature, even if long term?

This module implements regular expression operations. Regular expression syntax supported is a subset of CPython re module (and actually is a subset of POSIX extended regular expressions).\` -  [https://docs.circuitpython.org/en/latest/docs/library/re.html](https://docs.circuitpython.org/en/latest/docs/library/re.html)
