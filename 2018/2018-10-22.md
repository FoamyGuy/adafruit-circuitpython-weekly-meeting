### Libraries
I was looking at the Hacktoberfest statistics today. There are currently over 27,000 open issues tagged with Hacktoberfest. Thatâ€™s amazing in itself, however, the really great thing about that is that our issues are consistently getting addressed even with that massive number available. Great job, everyone!

## 20:50 Status Updates

@BravoDelta - lurking

24:32 @brennen
* Last week: Miscellaneous Pi testing and docs work.
* This week: Working on docs/libs for CircuitPython with Adafruitâ€™s Pi Hats, probably some other breakout boards, and whatever ad hoc testing @kattni needs.
* Experimenting with using CircuitPython for pedal-input keyboard events.

25:58 @cater - found a bug in MPR121 library helping out an Arduino issue in the forums, turn off to write to registered, being done in contructor but not after the fact. PRâ€™d something for CircuitPython. Issue or discussion?: NeoPixel library silently letting tuples that donâ€™t match RGB width, causes issues. 

27:12 @charlesburnaford - Nothing this week.

27:25 @danh
* PulseOut implemented on nrf
* 4.0.0-alpha.2 release
* PR reviews and merges
* Debugging nrf BLE/SPIM3 crash issue
* Looking at stack overflow and integer OverflowError issues
* Studying RTOSâ€™s for nrf: zephyr, mynewt
* Windows drivers: 32u4, Feather M0 Basic UF2 fixes

29:20 @deshipu - Today was the deadline for hackaday prize finals, so finished the prototype for barrette with CPX on it. Thatâ€™s finished. Continue working on it. Finally the pewpew arrived so have them and can start shipping them, if anyone wants to have one, they are on Tindie. https://www.tindie.com/products/14890/

30:43 @DrewFustini - for my recent work for I2C support of BeagleBone Black in Blinka
https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Blinka/pull/42
* I developed these changes using an Adafruit BME280 breakout board wired up to P9.19 (SCL) and P9.20 (SDA) and the Adafruit_CircuitPython_BME280 library
* Please note that this is just preliminary support. I2C support in Blinka on BeagleBone Black requires hard-coded workarounds in the following libraries.
  * Adafruit_CircuitPython_BusDevice
  * Adafruit_Python_PureIO
I still need to resolve the root cause and find an acceptable solution.
* The biggest challenge for me right now is related to:
Adafruit_CircuitPython_BusDevice
The current behavior is to do a blank write to the I2C address: i2c.writeto(device_address, b'')
This causes a write error on the BeagleBone Black

35:20 @fmorton - i am lurking, but want to let you know I submitted a PR to the mu editor to add a "Run" button and copy lib files to CIRCUITPY if the files are not already stored on CIRCUITPY. Works great with source code management. We are actively using this with kids at our maker space. The PR is https://github.com/mu-editor/mu/pull/485

31:53 @jepler - nothing to report

32:00 @jerryn
* PRâ€™s for DHT22 one in, one pending to fix RPi support
* Submitted PR to bitmapfont to simplify use
* Testing new CircuitPython-GFX library. 
* Working with Tiny LoRaWan -- testing Arduino example -- working on port to CP.

35:51 @josh - This week i've been working on upgrading EduBlocks to use the new Scratch blocks style which is more optimised for touch (blocks are larger with a bigger touch point), which will hopefully help when we get bluetooth working. Includes nice fields like sliders and workspace comments (like sticky notes) too for a better experience. A public BETA will be released this week.

36:39 @kattni

* MCP23xx guide is updated, old guide deprecated. NeoPixel Uberguide updated.
* MPR121 documentation updates completed by @cater.
* Added newest libraries to PyPi (permanently ongoing). MAX31856.
* Fixed up a bunch of repo-level issues identified by Adabot - you should notice that the issues list is a little shorter today!
* CircuitPython Library tracking issue: https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1246
* For this week:
* Fix slideshow lib bug.
* Update NeoPixel Raspberry Pi guide.
* Finish MCP3xxx guide.
* Next is Character LCD.
* Then finish the MatrixKeypad guide
* Update the CircuitPython library tracking issue (today).

38:44 @klardotsh - 

* What's new: finished a huge refactor of the KMK keyboard firmware project (I can now max out my personal typing speed ~100 WPM rather than it getting tripped up at 50WPM or so ðŸ™„), and added a bunch of neat more-advanced functionality to it. Found and reported a possible deadlock (and sometimes soft-brick) in CircuitPython (issue 1283). Finished my pinout/"port" of CircuitPython to MakerDiary's NRF52840 MDK board, submitted as PR 1286. This week: going to finish PR 1274 (modgzip/uzlib stuff), hopefully really make a repro scenario for 1283,  and even more hopefully add zip module support once 1274 goes through.

@ktown - nothing specific to add

@sdw_nj - lurking

41:24 @siddacious   

* Working on some bitmap wrangling for the board I'm working on. I'll probably use Aseprite (https://www.aseprite.org/) to whip up some simple animations and work on some code to drive them.
* Another board is at the fab that should make doing DIY cp boards even easier.
* I haven't forgotten about my DIY CP board tutorial but I'm pretty busy and my OS upgrade hid the notes file I was doing all my writing in as a sqlite file so I'll have to write something to pull those out :|

42:13 @sommersoft

* FRAM Library: I2C is almost done. I hope. ;D
* CircuitPython build tools: fixed README.txt placement in zip file.
* Adabot: initial command line args for log output and error depth PR'd. Awaiting confirmation on "disable prompt" issue; will work.
* This Week: Update Welcome To CircuitPython learn guide with new library bundle info (examples, versions). Adabot/Travis cron research discussion. And, time to re-focus on FrequencyIn.

22:12 @tannewt

* Added debug info the the generated frozen_mpy.c file for debugging file size/memory use.
* Worked on midi USB descriptors.
* Debugging it now. Hope to have a demo for show and tell on Wednesday.
* Will move back to displayio after MIDI because framebuf is being missed.
* Worked on toaster oven over the weekend and added stack overrun detection. Will PR today.

## 43:34 In the weeds

* 44:28 [text] @jerryn clarify 3.x vs 4.x bundle? - done; the bundles are the same (at least for now). There will always be a bundle matching the major version.
* 45:33 RPi-GPIO dependency (quick)
* 54:45 BLE agenda:
    * 55:40 bleio PR review
    * Higher level Python library above that
    * 1:22:00 SoftDevice vs RTOS's with Bluetooth and other stacks: zephyr, mynewt
* 49:43 @cater - library file/folder layout for i2c+spi things
* 51:31 @cater - class vs. instance level buffers
* 52:35 @cater - kicking travis without committing
