### 5:35 Libraries
CircuitPython Library Tracking Issue: https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1246

We’ve updated Adabot to make the output much cleaner and more accurate; all new/empty repos are no longer included in unnecessary checks and are identified in their own list. (I’ve updated the info below with the new output - so if the numbers don’t match the Overall, that’s why!) This will make the CircuitPython Library tracking issue (and the Weekly notes!) much less overwhelming and make it easier to identify repos that really have issues. Thanks to @sommersoft for the great work!

## 8:32 Hug Reports

11:00 @brennen
* @ladyada for pointers on libgpiod

11:18 @cater - massive group hug. Regular round of normal cast of characters being awesome.

11:58 @CGrover - group hug, still just amazing to watch the progress of team and community working together. Learning more quickly from interactions.

15:44 @siddacious
* To kattni, scott, cgrover, nis, sommersoft and everyone else who helped me troubleshoot the issues with the board who shall not be named and talked me off the ledge when things went more and more pear-shaped.
* To cgrover for a reminder that styrene is a thing that exists; it made my bezel making waay easier

16:24 @sommersoft
* Kattni for the many Adabot reviews/ideas
* Carter, Kattni, jerryn, deshipu, Dan, nis, and Scott for discord support this week; looking back it was quite busy!

## 17:19 Status Updates

20:22 @brennen
* Trying to do a bit more general code review.
* Tweaking platform detection in Adafruit_Python_GPIO and Adafruit_Blinka for Pi Zero, etc.
* Looking into packaging or optionally using libgpiod in Blinka.
* Grepping library READMEs for buggy string formatting on keywords.
* The flu’s loose in my house, so I might be out of commission for a while this week.

22:21 @cater - couple of things, did a property style access MPR121, good feedback on that, has a lot of flexibility, PR has good commentary. Rewrite of ADS1X15, complete rewrite. Bunch of other minor things, added PR to onewire, MPL115a2 lib, few other things like that.

23:43 @CGrover - automating an analog meter tester and characterisation tool, teaching class on reconditioning analog meters. Use CP and M4 express and oled and custom PCB, OSHPark rocks. This week: wrapping up code and enclosure for synth. Converting arduino project to CP. Rebuilding studio.

25:45 @charlesburnaford - very interested in your USB MIDI, trying to get started on adapting midi library to be able to have a python version of it. Ocarina code, convert to CircuitPython if having MIDI. using busio to pass into lib to interface with serial.

27:32 @dakotah.redstone - hugs all around. Still not far getting started with CircuitPython, so keeping up with everything. Discovered already gotten ESP32 mongoose installed.

28:21 @danh - 
* Merged arturo182’s bleio API
* In the midst of some revisions to that API; learning more about BLE in the process

25:59 @deshipu - there was an indie game festival this weekend, got them interested in pewpew. Going to inflict them on students. Otherwise laptop is still broken, still on code vacation.
@DrewFustini - lurking

30:39 @jerryn - playing a lot this week with the BluefruitSPI lib on a whole bunch of different boards, works with CPX even, been a lot of fun. Make some things can use as peripherals that can talk to nRF52s, quick testing with modifying scan program to work with new API, it runs. Been working on LoRA, but Brent is on the CP port. 300m range with no effort, working well. Otherwise just playing!

33:09 @kattni
* Last week:
   * Release and PyPI of Adafruit_CircuitPython_BluefruitSPI
   * Release and PyPI of BMP388
   * Updated lib tracking issue
   * Added all new libs to the bundle (this should be part of the process when a new lib is merged - release and bundle.)
   * Check all libs to make sure everything is in the bundle.
   * Added NeoPixel toggle demo to TrellisM4 repo.
   * Added page to Trellis M4 guide about Adafruit CircuitPython TrellisM4 library - explained rotation and coordinate layouts etc.
* This week:
   * Library Monday:
      * DONE - Update library tracking issue (https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1246)
      * Go through all libs to make sure everything is in the bundle
      * STARTED - Going through all the libs with updates since last release and do a new release
      * Start on fixing the example naming in the library repos
      * All about Adabot!
      * File issue on Adabot to check for sensor_simpletest.py examples
   * CharLCD shield, test on Metro M0/M4 with CircuitPython, update guide
   * IN PROGRESS - Adding trellis m4 library page for toggle demo
   * Test LSM9DS0, merge PR, release, etc.
   * MPL115A2 - needs PyPI update and deployment
   * PyPI guide updates to: ADXL345, MAX31856, LSM9DS1 and LSM9DS0

38:18 @sajattack
* https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_CharLCD/pull/18
* Rusty neopixels with nops mostly working, plans for more cross-platform SPI/DMA version, once I get a DMA hal going
* DMA hal started
* Metro M4 hal, clock initialization not yet functional
* Check out the effort to bring support for adafruit boards to a new(ish) systems programming language here: https://github.com/atsamd-rs/atsamd

40:08 @siddacious
* last week: Received and assembled the new boards, didn't work, couldn't figure out issues in time for a new board rev :(((((
* Scrapped the first board and assembled a second one that is working great though the boost converter needs rework before assembly
* Learned a lesson: never. ever trust someone else's footprints.
* Resolved to have a single example of the blinky Cyborg Raccoon for display at Designer Con instead of having some for sale :|
* Started assembly of a base, doing some woodwork to build in the TFT and made an initial bezel out of styrene.


* This week:
* Finish up the rest of the base, prep and paint.
* Work on more animations for the TFT and finalize coding for TFT and LED animations.
* Pack up the car and drive to Anaheim for Designer Con! http://www.designercon.com/
(we're in booth 1049 for anyone who wants to stop by)

42:16 @sommersoft
* Adabot:
   * Reduced the validators run on new/in-work libraries.
   * Added script to gather Library Bundle and PyPi download stats
   * Setup a .travis.yml to run Adabot on Travis. PR awaiting review.
* CircuitPython Build Tools: changed top level folder name to match zipfile name (use ‘-’ vs ‘_’). PR is merged, but repo needs a new release to push update to PyPi.
* FRAM Library: added SPI version; PR awaiting review.
* Received Particle Mesh boards late in the week; 2 Xenon [nRF52840], 1 Boron [cellular]. I’ve been reading the documentation and firmware code to see about possibly Blinka-izing them. A lot of linkers in their build which makes for “fun” hunting, and the mesh boards haven’t been merged in the repo just yet: https://github.com/particle-iot/firmware/tree/mesh-develop . Retaining full Particle usability may be difficult (Cloud, available peripherals, etc).
* This Week:
   * Some Adabot work: 
      * Finish ‘requests’ timeout handling
      * Fix list_repos(), which I broke
      * Extend check of ‘/examples’ for ‘sensor_simpletest’
   * Update core driver’s page


17:57 @tannewt
* Atmel USB switched to tinyusb! Thanks to Dan for review and Jerry for testing.
* Running down bugs then alpha.3.
* USB MIDI including EndpointOutputBuffer.
* Then…. displayio
