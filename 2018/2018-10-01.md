# 8:17 Hug Reports
10:52 @brennen - group hug this week.

11:04 @cater - one to @sommersoft for doing the cap1188 pr that I put in, another to @kattni for taking up the lib stuff, +1 - thanks to all of you for going to OHS

11:23 @charlesburnaford - group hug, didn’t do much this week

11:41 @danhalbert - 
* @kattni and @tannewt for being Adafruit comrades at the Open Hardware Summit
* @Drew Fustini for talking to us a lot at OHS about all kinds of things and hanging out with us
* @jerryn for continuing to test the latest 4.0 alpha releases in all kinds of ways

13:07 @deshipu - thanks to @MattyT for reaching out to try and get us to cooperate between CP and MP

13:33 @DrewFustini - thanks to Kattni and Dan, got to check out a workshop they did at a local university in Boston, interesting to see people using CPX and Gemma, and different successes and challenges, interesting to see how people use it

14:14 @jerryn - group hug to all, shout out to Dan for welcoming bug reports and fixing them quickly, also great to see @kattni taking the libs on, nice to have a focal point

14:50 @kattni
* @danhalbert for hosting me for Open Hardware Summit, and for taking me on a tour of Boston. Thank you so much for having me! 
* @tannewt and @danhalbert for an excellent trip, Open Hardware Summit was great, it was wonderful seeing you guys and I definitely wouldn’t have been able to navigate the trains without you 
* @adammhaile for their first PR to CircuitPython and they may be writing a new driver for us so thank you for that!
* Thanks to everyone for holding down Discord while we were travelling, I keep saying it but I’ll say it again: it’s so amazing to be able to step away and have everything remain smooth
* To everyone we met at Open Hardware Summit, it was great to meet you! Clarissa, Noah, Stephen, Stephanie, Jason, Drew, Andrew, Andy, Monica, Alex, Becky, Christi, Matt, Jo, Amitabh, Jimmie, Addie, Alicia, and everyone else I’ve missed. Thank you for taking the time to chat, I had many lovely discussions and thoroughly enjoyed all of them.
* Drew for all his involvement with OHS, lovely conversation and for picking up a couple of Lyfts and meals. Thank you for the invite to PS1, I’ll be taking you up on it in a couple of months.
* @ntoll for the Mu update
* @cater and @jerryn for jumping in on the lib issue when we posted it, more discussion is always helpful

16:30 @mikebarela - Great to see everyone at maker faire, I can put names to faces. Thanks all for the help with CircuitPython the last 2 weeks

@sdw_nj - lurking

17:28 @siddacious - group hug and a one for Kattni for getting the MAX31856 repo setup. I'll totally make a PR when I can convince git to report my pseudonym correctly. Also to Carter for resolving my dotstar lib PR that will allow me to use fancyLED with them now. I'll put in the same for Neopixels when I get a spare minute unless someone beats me to it.

@sommersoft
* Just a gigantisaurus group hug this week

9:25 @tannewt
* @sommersoft for help on the Discord
* @ntoll for Mu 1.0.1
* @dan halbert and @kattni for awesome advocacy at the open hardware summit

# 18:44 Status Updates
23:00 @brennen
* Raspberry Pi library testing & guide updates; GPS at the moment, a long list to come.

24:15 @cater - quick test/merge of dotstar fix, cap touch sensor, screwed up the connection to travis, needs to be resolved before merge.

25:05 @charlesburnaford - fingering pad for music project. Having trouble with mcp23017, going to put in an issue to find out if doing something wrong.

25:41 @danhalbert
* Attended Open Hardware Summit: spent time in talks and also in the hallway, and before and after social events. Talked with many other OSHW vendors and makers. Tour of gigantic 43k sq ft Artisan’s Asylum maker space in Somerville, MA.
* Reset nRF peripherals on soft-reset in 4.0.
* Debugging other SPI issues.
* Will continue with nRF implementation.

27:08 @deshipu - Made a release of the firmware for µGame with CP 3.0.2, without including all the stuff I wanted it to have — it's been too long already. Also, 5 CircuitPython badge prototypes were given to volunteers at the last pycon.uk, and now we are discussing ways to improve them.

27:48 @DrewFustini - just got back from travelling for the last two weeks, going to be looking at getting I2C and SPI working on Beaglebone in Blinka

28:08 @jerryn - much of the week was at a family wedding, not much circuitpython, did play with the pirkeys, playing with them a bit and having fun, testing out some of the things adding devices to nRF dongle boards, travel over and can get into some of the PRs and issues out there to help with them

29:18 @kattni
* Finally home for a while and ready to hit the ground running.
* Last week was Open Hardware Summit - met a lot of amazing people, learned about some new things and got to see an amazing makerspace in Boston. Had a ton of fun with that.
* This week will be digging in and getting back into the swing of things. 
* Getting back into PyPi - we’re about half done, but that was apparently the easy half! Most of them are already on PyPi, it’s the testing/guide updates/etc that are half done. I’ll be getting the last few into PyPI, working on getting a couple of new libs, but if you hear about or have libs that you’d like to see, please let me know and we can try to work them in sooner.
* It’s Library Time! I’ll be starting to work through the open PRs and issues on the library repos, as well as working through all the repo-specific issues noted by Adabot above (in the notes). There’s a lot to be done here and anyone interested in helping is entirely welcome. I’m still not sure how I plan to handle it but it may start involving weekly roundups and requests for help on different things. If you have open PRs or issues on libraries, expect to start seeing some action on those. As the project has grown we’ve not been keeping up with this and that will be changing, so thank you for your patience with us if you have been waiting for a response.

34:20 @mikebarela - I've mainly been working on the newsletter - if you'd like to receive the weekly newsletter for Python on Microcontrollers, visit adafruitdaily.com and sign up - spam free, your info never sold, leave anytime w/o hassle.

@sdw_nj - lurking

@siddacious - 
* Got my 1x1 SAMD21 board up and running and and half assembled, mainly fiddling with itty bitty dotstars mounted and wired on my micro breakouts. I missed the deadline for the contest but I’m trying to get it finished just to say I did. I might do a revision without the dotstars as a fun general purpose wearable board and will probably inevitably make an M4 version.
* I’ll send out my CP-32M4 board once I work with oshpark (Drew?) on my micro usb footprint issue and can make a new footprint for the newer better connector. My other battery powered board will also see another revision to try to lower the BOM cost and adjust some dimensions. 
* Spent airport time working on my board design tutorial and realized that it probably wants to be a three parter, so I got about half way through the first draft of the first part though many parts will probably be best described in video form so I’ll have to think about doing that as a companion. 
* In non-programming news I helped move my moms from Arizona to Nevada and saw many tesla chargers on the way.
* PS: If anyone has suggestions for accessories to get with a first oscilloscope, please let me know. With any luck I’ll finally be getting a DS-1054Z after squirreling away duckets and shekels for a while now.

37:37 @sommersoft
* *FrequencyIn**: Dormant this week.
* **FRAM Library**: I2C is ready for initial PR, pending one Sphinx fix. Will start SPI after that is pushed.

19:20 @tannewt
* Web design help for downloads landing page
   * Planning to support more than Adafruit SAMD21 boards
* Trellis Express changes
* AudioIn work
* Paused displayio until audio stuff is done
* Hacktoberfest!!!
* Adabot improvements for languages

# 38:14 In The Weeds
39:12 What to do with .frozen libs - per issue: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/issues/93
1:02:38 @jerryn: weeds question -- or just can someone point me to where to look in code for Control-C handling?
1:05:55 @cater - adding features vs. smaller code trade-offs
