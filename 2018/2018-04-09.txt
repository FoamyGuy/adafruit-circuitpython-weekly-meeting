sommersoft 12:47
@tannewt and @Dan Halbert for the constructive feedback on my long-lived PRs. And again, @kattni for churning out guides and code like a tornado. Group hugs beyond that!

ladyada
yep great work from dan on getting HID working on m4, kattni+noe+pedro on the trampoline guide, pt for working on the Awesome List for circuitPython: https://github.com/adafruit/awesome-circuitpython

Status 14:00

tannewt 14:19
* Close to getting wave file playback going. Including stereo and to I2S
* Found a memory hogging bug that is from an old heap pointer on the stack.
* Found a memory bug resulting from unknown register state.
* Newsletter goes out tomorrow!
* Any mission critical things that need to be fixed before Alpha that ships on Metro M4?
* Hobby: Brainstorming CircuitPython on Game Boy / Game Gear.

dhalbert 21:21
* finished HID in 3.0
* includes consumer controls/ multimedia keys. PLAY, STOP, etc
* probably adding joystick too.
* jerryn trying REPL based file system erase

jepler 22:40
This last week, I got up to speed on building for ESP8266, and submitted a PR for that.  I am still working on getting all the fuzzing bug reports from 2-3 weeks ago filed.  I did two simple projects, one to help with "intermediate frequency alignment" of radio receivers (generating some analog signals and controlling an AD9850), and one to show accurate time from on the OLED feather wing.  Neither is up on github yet; I may be asking for help to turn the NTP stuff into a library for CircuitPython though.

jerryn 24:05
* Connecting m0 to wifi through esp8266. CPX logging to adafruit.io. Write-up please!
* back to stmpe driver. need template repo

kattni 26:32
* starting working on datalogging project. ran into a bunch of problems
* log data and import it into a graphing program
* wrote up software page for led trampoline
* guide with Mu plotter videos
* heads down on datalogging guide
* traveling wednesday

Noe 28:30
* usb hid joystick mouse using kattni's sample code
  * https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-essentials/circuitpython-hid-keyboard-and-mouse#circuitpython-mouse-emulator
* make something similar to: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1090461

@sommersoft 30:55
Still working PulseIn; reached the limits of debug I think. Saleae should be delivered Thursday, so that will help. Might pick up an "easy" 3.x issue in the meantime, or focus on some writing/documentation.

Discussion (In the weeds)
* Joystick discussion 31:50
  * what features/buttons should our stock "gamepad" device support?
  * xbox vs ps4
* fun project from noe 41:30
  * thanks dan for gamepad support! blank slate vs hacking an existing one
  * saturn 5 lego project
  * light up blume below the rocket: https://medium.com/@realasa/making-a-lego-saturn-v-blast-off-af5adc55d6f
