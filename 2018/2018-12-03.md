## 23:48 Status Updates
@azure skies - lurking

30:20 @brennen
* Last week:
   * Various Blinka tweaks / reviews - next release will install RPi.GPIO by default, added some libgpiod wrapper stuff that will be included in orangepi support, etc.  
   * CharLCD testing.
* This week:
   * Test Motor FeatherWing, TLC5947 (for negative indexing PR from ArthurDent62).
   * Pulling platform detection out of Adafruit_Blinka and Adafruit_Python_GPIO into Adafruit_Python_PlatformDetect.
   * Have actually been using my footswitch input project, so going to make some tweaks there and get around to finishing documentation.

32:14 @cater - tmp006 - wrote that lib. SPI FRAM reviewed, finally merged, tested. All the other small things.

32:58 @CGrover - Working on PCB designs this past week, not so much with CircuitPython. Besides shrinking the size of the lunchbox synth daughterboard, I’ve been playing around with PCB art and backlighting with SMD LEDs designed for reverse-mounting. It’s more difficult and mysterious than I thought it would be.
Next week will be focused on two CircuitPython NeoTrellis projects (and one “classic” Trellis, too), a musique concrete instrument, and wrapping up some project enclosures.

33:38 @charlesburnaford - not a lot of updates, stuck with baudrate problem, but that’s gone.

34:05 @danh - 
* Continuing nRF API work - planning to split `Device` into `LocalPeripheral`, `RemotePeripheral`, `LocalCentral`, `RemoteCentral`, or something conceptually like that
* Incompatible changes made to busio.UART for 4.0 to match PySerial API - Note in particular timeout is now in float seconds instead of milliseconds
* Researching ADC issues on M4

@deshipu - lurking

36:11 @jerryn
* Kind of unfocused week - lots of interesting sidetracks -- too many toys!
* Delved into a strange RPi SPI issue reported on the Forum -- turns out to be limited to using the LSM9DS1 with other SPI devices on RPi has some issues. Lots of headscratching.
* Sidetracked by playing with particle.io boards -- looking forward to CP port for them.
* Using CP libraries on RPi a lot more now - make it really easy to interface with adafruit.io
* Next week -- probably more of the same...

37:52 @kattni
* Last week:
   * Library Monday!
   * Various support on Discord and the forums
   * Live streamed the GitHub review process for @dakotah.redstone
   * Finished up text on the Trellis M4 NeoPixel toggle demo guide page
   * Updated Motor FeatherWing guide to current design with wiring diagram and install instructions.
   * Went through all of the library issues and commented on many, closed a few, moved one to the appropriate repo. If I pinged you, please take a look when you get a chance, thanks!
* This week:
   * Library Monday:
      * There are a number of libs that need releases
      * Go through the responses I received from last week’s issue sweep
      * Update library tracking issue
      * Verify everything’s in the bundle, etc.
      * If you’re looking for a way to get into contributing to the CircuitPython project, please look at the CP library tracking issue, check out some of those issues,  there are a number of good first time issues: https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1246
   * Email about whether to deprecate RPi guide related to recent PR merged
   * Get @sommersoft added to the FRAM guides as a contributor 
   * Trellis M4 NeoPixel toggle demo page needs photos/GIFs - Priority
   * Motor FeatherWing code has been tested successfully on RPi (Thanks @brennen!), so I’ll be finishing the update on the Motor FeatherWing Guide page with the RPi instructions etc (fritzing already done)
   * Potentially pull out Motor FeatherWing helper library into its own helper library
      * Works on Pi hat and potentially shield.
   * Next up: Motor Shield and Motor Pi Hat guides.
      * Shield needs testing
      * Pi hat already tested
   * Then guide updates for: seesaw, ADXL345, MAX31856, LSM9DS1, LSM9DS0
   * Needs guide: 74HC595

42:08 @shawnhymal - Port CP including UF2 bootloader to a number of different non-adafruit boards, Arduino mkr0, ultimately create a guide on putting a bootloader on the board using a .ino, will be doing PRs to CP repo with the different board defs - everything in the M0 line, from that learn.adafruit guide, showing how also to put CircuitPython on these boards as well. As long as you have a SAMD21, you can put CP on it. Got UF2 up and running, works for mkr0, currently writing test suite to test pins and protocols, hopefully very few modifications to test other boards. GitHub somewhere for the test suite.

48:02 @sommersoft
* Last Week:
   * Adabot:
      * Added an Arduino library script for comparing release tag to library properties
      * Finished up ability to run CircuitPython library validators "a la carte"
      * Hopefully fixed bundle updates for running Adabot on Travis
   * FRAM: Finished up SPI version
* This Week:
   * Update FRAM Learn Guides with CircuitPython usage
   * Add "haz commits, needs release" to Adabot Arduino

@soundmasteraj - lurking

24:21 @tannewt
* Debugged issue with QSPI flash on upcoming Feather nRF52840
* Added auto update of release files for upcoming CircuitPython website. Will need volunteers to help fill out info for all CircuitPython boards.
* Fixed up nRF builds after Nordic moved the files.
* Redid adafruit_build_bins in Python and will be renaming shortly.
* Polished up and merged Mini SAM board support.
* Responded to Dan on Grand Central and got it merged.
* Fixed commit build versions so they include the last tag.
* Did “live reviewing” stream thanks to Dakotah for the suggestion. Posting video today.


* Adding Particle board support to CircuitPython. Trying some things to speed up atmel builds as well.
* Sidetracked into nRF UF2 bootloader. Want to get LED blinks same as samd UF2 blinks.
* Dean has left Adafruit for his own Guitar and Synth adventures. Anyone want to pick up his Mixer work? https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/1365
* Can someone help clarify the screenshot of GitHub is old on this page: https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/installing-circuitpython

28:20 @ladyada - 
* im doing a lot of embedded linux ports for blinka so you can run circuitpython code/drivers on various SBC's - all are welcome to add support for their boards

28:30 @adafruit
* one update for weekly chat, the awesome-circuitpython list was updated…
* awesome-circuitpython is a curated list of awesome CircuitPython guides, videos, libraries, frameworks, software and resources. Lots of updates, the latest include: added newsletter archive list, added the latest boards that run CircuitPython from Adafruit, Sparkfun, and Digi-Key python section, added video newsletter podcast playlists, added the Adafruit Hallowing m0 express in hardware, added the CircuitPython libraries in code, added CircuitPython in MicroSolutions Digital Magazine, The Amp Hour #383 in news, and added CircuitPython Development Workshop in books. Did we miss anything? Make the awesome list more awesome by adding to it! - awesome-circuitpython @
