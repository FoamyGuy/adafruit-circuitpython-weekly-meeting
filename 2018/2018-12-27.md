Thank you everyone for an amazing 2018! We say Code + Community = CircuitPython, and we mean it - without the community, CircuitPython is simply code. We’ve had so many new contributors and new community members this year. We began on 3.0 at the end of last year and released it in July of this year. We’re currently working on 4.0 which will bring bluetooth support to the new nRF52840 boards. Our community has been growing and it’s been wonderful to see all the projects and ideas members have been working on throughout the year. Thank you everyone for being such an important part of what we do and we’re looking forward to seeing what comes next. We’re incredibly grateful to all of you for being a part of this adventure, and we are excited to continue in 2019!

## 16:39 Status Updates

30:23 @brentr
* working on radio modules, on a guide for doing rpi with RFM radio modules, 

30:56 @cater
* not a lot this week, smattering of small low hangy fruit things, gas sensor, issue for oled display verify the lib will work, issue closed 

31:32 @CGrover
* wrapped up STEMMA to eurorack synth test, involved building an external dac module, powered from STEMMA 3.3v power supply. Side note - eurorack synths, have to give up food for at least a week or so
* STEMMA classic MIDI interface off to OSHPark

33:17 @danh
* Reviewed a number of PR’s
* Working on nRF52 `bleio` implementation. Advertising is working, connecting after advertising not yet working
* Finished travis-ci.com migration and readthedocs migration to webhooks

34:46 @jerryn
* Lots of testing of the ESP_ATConrtol library updates - it is working very well!
* Tested posting to AdafruitIO using webhooks
* Works very well on particle_argon  (all on one board)
* Working on guide updates for ESP_ATControl
* Simple PR to remove framebuf rom nrf build and use QSPI
* Trying to understand/fix an issue that sometimes occurs when loading AT Firmware to ESP8266.

17:20 @kattni
* Two CircuitPython workshops in Chicago last week, went great! 50+ new CircuitPython community members!
* Merged 120+ PRs to update the READMEs to travis-ci.com
* Deprecated a number of Python/MicroPython libraries/guides.
* All the things I forgot I did.
* Keeping up with Library work, new libraries!
* Adding SharpMemoryDisplay and PCD8544 to PyPI
* Would appreciate some assistance with releases.
* Need to get CPyLibians added to new repos.
* ServoKit FeatherWing guide is live, need to update shield and HAT guides still
* Needs to be tested on Pi HAT
* Going to be taking on some GitHub issues that need to be cleaned up
* Look into automating more of PyPI.
* Adding some issues to cookiecutter - adding more default files and some fixes needed

21:37 @ladyada 
* Graphics and wifi stuff - framebuf, st7565 might add
* If there’s over displays people use, please put in an issue
* Pillow image support - allow linux users to use monochrome displays like rpi or something
* Moving onto RGB graphics, software fallback for displayio
* Poking slowly at adding FT232H support to Blinka, some help would be useful
* Allow people to use CP on Windows/Mac using chip to interface with hardware
* People who want to try the wifi coproc stuff, please test, api may be tweaked
* BSD socket support over AT commands

25:18 @roy
* Jumped back into RGB LED /Pixelbuf stuff, accelerate dotstar and neopixel
* Implement autowrite stuff 
* Compiles

26:41 @ShawnHymel
* Nothing new this week

27:42 @sommersoft
* Last Week:
* Library README updates for the Travis badge.
* This Week:
* Unsure, and open to suggestion! Maybe I should re-attack FrequencyIn; 4 months seems long enough to ignore something. :smile:
* Sweep Adabot library checks for necessary updates related to Travis .com migrations

28:41 @TG-Technie
* Past week - porting text support code from lib to circuitpython gfx lib, added round rectangle to gfx, learned about linting, 
* Next week - ordering a board that runs CP, would like hardware review. 

##37:06 In The Weeds

38:00 @adafruit (pt)
* Discuss topics for CircuitPython repo
* Micropython
* python    
* embedded
* microcontroller
* Cpython
* Python3
* Education
* beginner
* 39:00 CircuitPython 2019 - https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/12/17/what-do-you-want-from-circuitpython-in-2019-circuitpython2019-circuitpython/
* Newsletter’
* 40:06 Nordic … Poster approved
* 40:39 “Star drive” - fun, new years day project…

42:00 @jerryn 
* 42:24 Encourage use of micropython for esp8266/esp32
* 42:35 Recommendations for feather_nrf52832 (arduino/myNewt…)
* @sommersoft notes that older versions are stable and available for dropped platforms
* 44:25 @adafruit (PT) - project driven, we’ll show how to use these boards with different things
 
44:45 @Roy - autowrite for RGBLED/Pixelbuf as well as backwards compatibility needs.
* Callback or abstract method better way of doing this? 
* 51:00 Backwards compatibility is important
* 52:00 - when to make the change from current to pixelbuf. Bundles to not have to be the same in the future.
* 53:43 @Roy - ask about what it would take to add FFT or similar to CircuitPython.
* M4 only, hardware. Tough to split apart FFT, somethings like filters and FFTs, you need the C code, would add it as a native assist. Open an issue. Need an API.

## 56:60 Wrap up
