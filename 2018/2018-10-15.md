## 10:00 Hug Reports
13:44 @brennen
* @sommersoft and @tannewt for review of trellis PR
* kattni for ongoing stewardship of library project.

14:22 @cater - Dan for helping out with Travis on MCP3xxx repo. Sommersoft for catching the blunder on CAP1188 lib into the bundle and Kattni for helping undo it! Jerry and Sommersoft for DHT quirk that came up this weekend, and jerry for PR to fix it. KTown for helping out with something with LSM303 and the PR to fix it. Process1183 for the DRV2605 board discussion, PR in for it, thanks for hanging in on the ongoing discussion.

16:40 @CGrover - (No mic this week due to some local bandwidth issues.) 
Group hug to team for helping me learn and grow. Although I don’t understand all the Discord discussions, I’m continuing to learn and apply new (to me) concepts and techniques. Special shout-out this week to Phil B, “The LED Whisperer,” for his CPy FancyLED library. It’s amazing – saving a lot of effort and producing some excellent color fades for a couple of projects. Also to @JohnPark: his recent animation learning guide opened my eyes to a better way to “frame” some NeoPixel strip animations to simplify the code, improving speed and performance.

17:29 @charles_burnaford - general hug report to everybody, learning a lot from listening to everyone

17:50 @dakotah_redstone - general hugs to community, hesitant hug to JohnPark

18:10 @danh
   * Kattni, carter, sommersoft, brennen for the library bug fixes and improvements
   * Jepler for the travis improvements
   * Scott for designing and implementing Mixer so fast
   * All the translators for their continued work, and for keeping up with our changing the messages out from under them
   * MikeB for managing the CircuitPython newsletter and for continued great guide work 

19:20 @deshipu - Thanks to JohnPark for getting hollowing to work with the supercon badge. Titimoby finally trying to build a CP board.

19:57 @jerryn - Hug to Carter and Sommersoft for always being there to discuss issues that come up. General hug to Dan for constant trying to clean up and smooth out nRF issues that come up. Group hug!

20:30 @kattni
   * Carter and Sommersoft for all the library work, PR reviews, merges, overall involvement. You have made the transition into Keeper of the Libraries super smooth and I really appreciate it.
   * Brennan for continuing to work through PyPi stuff - thank you for always being there to test the weird stuff I find.
   * Dan for talking through some important things with me, thank you for your support
   * Carter, Sommersoft, and Jerry for all the effort put into helping a user this weekend with an issue that turn out to be a bug
   * Jerry for finding a fix for the bug and putting in a PR

21:31 @klardotsh - My hug report is over text because I'm at work: shout-out to Scott for the great discussion and help on the KMK project and for working with @kdb424 and I on how to move from our hacked up fork of CircuitPython to proper upstream CPy. (and for ideas on upstream contributions we can make towards that goal). Cheers!

22:26 @ladyada - pre-hug report to scott for mixer - will test soon!
hugz to all the library helprs - so much happening! jerry, sommersoft, carter are killin' it

22:43 @sommersoft
   * Carter for the FRAM library review, discussion, and reminding me of Python one-liners...always forget about those.
   * Scott for the review on circuitpython-build-tools.
   * Kattni for the review/merge on adabot
   * Jerryn and Carter for always being ready to battle DHT/AMxxx...and winning!
   * @process1183 for the Hacktoberfest PRs.
   * The biggest of big hugs for the Group. Such a blast being involved with this community and project!

10:48 @tannewt
   * Dan for Windows driver work and forum support
   * Carter for all of the PR reviews for Hacktoberfest folks. Also for unifying external ADC APIs
   * Josh and Kyle from the KMK keyboard firmware project. Really interesting discussions around CircuitPython on an “appliance” that should just work but still be hackable.
   * Melissa, Amanda and Mariatta for speaker mentorship for PyCascades.
   * CGrover for detailed analysis of AudioOut’s output.
   * Mike for releasing the newsletter so I don’t have to!
   * Sommersoft and dastels for fixing perk up ears example which used old Servo.

## 23:27 Status Updates
27:27 @brennen - continuing to test / tweak libraries on raspberry pi as they come up, reviewing PRs where appropriate.  spent a day on trellis library last week.  updating docs, etc.

27:50 @cater - Various things. MCP3xxx library once Dan got Travis fixed, did a bunch of tiny fixes to get Travis green, did a review and tested it, and afaict, it’s functional and set to go. Did a fix for LSM9DS1 - SPI class was never tested, got that fixed. For the DS0, discontinued, but lib still needs to be updated, blind PR for that fix. Checked EPD PR and it worked. Ongoing code review for FRAM.

29:44 @CGrover - Revamping the NeoPixel strip animations for the UFO Lighting Controller. Incorporating the FancyLED library is the current activity. I’ve been benchmarking the performance of animation frames so that the incremental performance improvements are measured and can be weighed.
Next week I hope to get back to the music synthesizers and Eurorack work whilst revamping and replacing recording studio equipment.

30:32 @dakotah_redstone - 

31:07 @danh
   * Implemented PWMOut for nrf52.
   * Working on PulseOut for nrf52
   * nrfx changes to make our use of it easier
   * Windows drivers
   * Assistive technology: mouse/keyboard button box. Finally getting back to this and should be able to show it to the user soon.

33:30 @deshipu - Still over my head at day job. Worked on project qualified for hackaday prize, like CPX, control a lot of things,https://hackaday.io/project/160167, only one week left.

@fmorton lurker but having fun with some small libraries for young students, such as https://github.com/fmorton/Makers_CircuitPython_remote_control

34:57 @jerryn - little things distracting from bigger things. Spent time last week with nRF and SPI BLE issue, crashing it. Found a workaround, but waiting on root cause. DHT thing turned out to be really interesting, took a while to sort, subtle timing bug in the startup of DHT code. Carter was going to bring up None in general. PR in for it. Setup LoRaWAN gateway last week. Working on project Ladyada brought up TinyLoRaWAN porting to CP. Working on that.

37:36 @kattni
   * Fixed the issue with CAP1188 not deploying to PyPi
   * Helped Carter fix the issue with CAP1188 being in the wrong place in the lib bundle
   * CAP1188 and DotStar guides completed and updated with CP/RPi setup and usage
   * Finished Adafruit CircuitPython Slideshow helper lib - it’s super fancy, if you have a Hallowing, check it out!
   * Updated the Library tracking issue
   * Up for this week:
   * Take a look at changes needed for MPR121 examples/docs - see if Carter can help with this.
   * Continue working through updating/creating guides for CP/RPi updates - MCP230xx is up next (also has a guide that needs to be deprecated), MCP3xxx, and NeoPixel.
   * Continue keeping lib PRs on the radar - this has been working incredibly well! (Thanks again to everyone to keeps taking care of these!) 
   * Take care of some of the repo-level issues identified by Adabot

39:59 @klardotsh 
   * Core: submitted PR #1274 (modgzip support for boards powerful/flash-heavy enough to actually run uzlib)
   * Core-ish?: prototyped an `__import__` replacement that could load gzipped py modules (https://gist.github.com/klardotsh/cfe3038c59abbc6bb15be4cc6127497c)
   * Core: brainstormed ZIP module support
   * KMK: rebased off upstream CircuitPython 4.0.0-alpha1, flashing over USB MSC rather than DFU/UF2 (https://github.com/KMKfw/kmk_firmware/pull/69)
   * This week: continuing all the above ^, working with @kdb424 on serial/I2C split keyboard support in KMK-land

42:10 @ladyada - i was under the weather most of last week, not a lot happened

42:58 @sommersoft - 
   * FRAM Library: I2C PR is on the move. SPI PR imminent, after change requests are merged into that branch.
   * Circuitpython-build-tools: now includes examples in .py/.mpy bundles, and makes an examples bundle. After merge, repo update needs to be pushed to PyPi...of which I cannot exactly help with. :D
   * Minor fix to the cookiecutter for the README’s Travis badge.
   * This week: adabot command line. @tannewt, I’ve noticed you’ve used `Click` over `argparse`...do you have a preference?

24:04 @tannewt
   * Got Mixer merged in
   * Update Trellis M4 board def
   * Released 3.0.3
   * Working on ramping DAC value up and down to minimize popping. M4 is being finicky. M0 looks good.

## 44:31 In the weeds
   * 45:05 Cater MCP3xxx stuff - release it!
   * 45:50 how to do custom i2c stuff through i2cdevice (see FRAM)
   * 53:50 how to document get/setitem
   * 55:39 Carter - None in general
   * 1:08:25 re: huzzah esp 32 circuit python support
   * 1:11:43 ESP USB rumors

1:12:30 wrap-up
