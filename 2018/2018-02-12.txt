* wolf for helping with guide code for ikea lamp
* dhalbert and tannewt for sitting in on crazy debugging

sommersoft 13:48
* @tannewt for a really good review and suggestions on Trellis lib. Group hug for support efforts this week on discord; I think the community really values this, and it keeps new members coming back.

Status 14:43

* Heads down on 3.x. Bug me if you are blocked by me for more than 24 hours.
* Got analogio, bitbangio merged in.
* pulseio is next. PWMOut is implemented and compiles but doesn't work yet. Not using ASF4 at all.

tdicola 16:20
* library si4713, fm transmitter. done, guide updated
* pressure sensor, mpl. lib done but guide skipped
* top priority to port firmata to circuitplayground express
* lsm303, vml6070 guide updates needed

arturo182 17:55
This week I'll try to look at #588 (Rename pins to match nRF convention), #615 (Add safe mode to nRF boards) and general nRF HAL cleanup.

bravodelta 18:33

This week, I was able to interface CP2104 PiUART to
an old 8051-based microcontroller project, to replace an
aging MAX3232 serial interface to the host PC. I also
finally figured out how to do the RESET and C2 (two-wire
programming) lines for this development system, which
requires pin sharing.  The C2 interface provides in-
circuit debugging as well as programming an uninitialized
device.  Since the Silabs C8051F330D only has 20 pins (it
shipped in a now-deprecated DIP-20 package) and C2 isn't
used all that often, it makes sense to share the pins for
both C2CK and /RST (RESET).  It all works now, exactly as
the original amrFORTH system did.  Serial bootloader code
tweaking on both the host PC and the microcontroller figured
as well.
PiUART == awesome!
Also did a 14-segment alphanumeric display this week, the
hard way. ;)  Kept up on discipline and have been diligently
capturing schematics, using Fritzing.

Update: fought LED changes to Trellis all day Saturday; don't try forcing class inheritance when it isn't needed. Got past that, now just working out the buffer slicing for LED & buttons. No movement on isSerialConnected, but that's a quick one to finish. Will visit open issues later in the week for next task.
