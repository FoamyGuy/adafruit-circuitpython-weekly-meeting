Hug Reports 6:23
* siddacious and sommersoft for helping TG-Techie get building
* sigafoos for named tuple accelerometer PR
* sommersoft and kattni for more doc work and PRs
* jerryn for dotstar gemma fix
* kevin j walters for ws2801 library

Andon 8:15
Group Hug. Still busy with other things, so havent' paid much attention, but I'm sure you are all doing awesome stuff.

brentr 8:35
hug report for @tannewt for being on one of my favorite podcasts (the amp hour). I listened to it on my flight and it made time fly.

cater 9:01
fly on the wall mode for me this week. no mic. no updates. group hug.

cefn 9:22

cgrover 9:41
Group hug for all the work on 2.2.4!

dhalbert 9:53
* hug to tannewt@ for shared-bindings refactor is very nice

deshipu 10:44
* group hug!
* congrats on alpha 3!

hukuzatuna 11:17
* kattni who has been working very hard on dotstar express vs non-express

jerryn 11:46
* congrats on alpha 3. happy to have it all working
* haven't found anything broken yet
* kattni for helping newcomer to #projecthelp on discord

kattni 12:25
* hukuzatuna testing help for guides
* sommersoft for doc PRs and dotstar pointers
* group hug for everyone helping

nis 13:00
* tdicola for documentation on how to build CircuitPython
* Hug report to Tony DiCola for the initial work on documenting the building of CircuitPython from source:
https://learn.adafruit.com/micropython-for-samd21/build-firmware
(Initially this was Micropython for Adafruit product line, more than a year ago)
The present Vagrantfile is verified correct by me. ;)  There's enough info in the Vagrantfile to build everything, if you look. ;)
Was able to build the 3.0.0. Alpha-2 from those instructions, this week!
@Dan Halbert for pointing out the presence of 74HC595 Shift Register in the AF LCD backpack.

noe 13:29
Group hug!

sommersoft 13:50
Group hug this week. And @Noe for ATizing last week's project.

wolf 14:10
Hug from me, then.  A Vagrantfile is just what I need!

cefn 16:10
Apparently couldn't connect mic, sorry. Looking forward to trying out alpha3, thanks to tannewt for guiding me on conformance for  https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Micropython_Blinka and tannewt and ladyada for comments/feedback. Had a sprint on prepping @ShrimpingIt kits last week but now available again

Status 14:48

tannewt 15:17
* Fixed up USB and pulseio in Alpha 2 and released Alpha 3
* Brain is chewing on audio API tweaks. Goal is to separate audio sources from destinations so we can use PWM, DAC, I2S or PDM interchangeably.
* Found and tweak SVD based GDB helper which makes it easy to read peripheral memory.
* Revamping Python on MicroControllers newsletter. Join at Adafruit Daily: https://www.adafruitdaily.com/

andon 19:23
Nothing CP-related. Main project is continuing to re-chip the DigiBadges for a convention at the end of the month, but I've also taken up writing a standard python program to generate random tectonic plates. It's absolutely not something I need to make, but... Well, I'm going to do it anyway.

brentr 20:00
nothing cp related, spinning back up from vacation

cefn 20:36
Next is SPI

CGrover 20:57
Running 2.2.4 on all projects and its working great!
Working on motor driver for string car. Merged with model train controller
still a newbie

dhalbert 24:00
* usb hid descriptor work
* reproduced the descriptors from 2.2.4 with 3.0.0
* turning on hid in asf4 not documented at all
* verifying hid report version

deshipu 25:15
nothing CP-related

hukuzatuna 25:50
* finished up testing of various boards and devices for kattni
* played with laser cutter in maker space
* ready for next round of testing
* UART is next

jerryn 26:42
* played with am23 temp sensor. replacing dht11s. i2c is better!
* scroll phat from pimoroni (7 x 17 dotstars). easy to use with charlieplex circuitpython driver
* lis3dh found issue with tap example on any version
* gemma m0 dotstar, pirkey may need dotstar enabled too

kattni 29:21
* working on essentials guide, pwm, servo, cap touch, internal rgb led. UART, i2c, storage and cpu temp left
* already available in board guides
* lots of PR review

nis 31:12
Tracebacks (vs gforth). vector graphics oscope netpbm. 74HC595 (shift register driving 7-segment LED array) in CircuitPython quickest route this week over Arduino (SPI ready in CircuitPython due to prior work by me). Status LED CircuitPython proving useful.
See scrollback for a more detailed (haha) report.

Noe 32:52
circuitpython foot switch. published wednesday
Put cad drawings into github: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CAD_Parts

sommersoft 34:38
Got debug working over the weekend on the "128char max paste in REPL". Still working my way to grabbing fully useful data with atmel studio & GDB, but the picture is a getting clearer. And to retract my statement from last week: docs are never done. :D

wolf 35:31
I’m currently working on two things in the pursuit of asyncio: selectors and deque.  Not much progress yet since I’ve had a busy week here at work, but I’m still on-track for delivery of asyncio before PyCon; no impassible road-blocks yet.  I’ve got all the hardware I need and I’m gonna start running things on the CPX.  My goal remains asyncio to allow rainbows and IR to coexist.

Discussion (in the weeds) 36:34
* suggestions for Adafruit_CircuitPython_Motor (CGrover) 36:44
  * DC motor control
  * they are linear so you can calculate distance once you know speed
  * Add initial voltage required for spinning
  * recalculate optimum speed based on battery depletion. know when to head home and charge
  * TODO: file an issue on Adafruit_CircuitPython_Motor
* dotstar weirdness 41:52 kattni
  * dotstar updating varies for each board
  * TODO: follow up with circuitpython issue
* write up issue for testing 3.0, expand existing issue
