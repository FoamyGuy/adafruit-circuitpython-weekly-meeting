Hug Reports: 5:35

* CGrover for helping CRV on Discord
* baldengineer, cgrover and nis helping zipmaster on discord
* nis for helping sheckey
* arturo182 for contributions to nRF52 port

tdicola 7:01
* no hug reports

deshipu 7:30

andon 7:37
Group hug to everyone, and going to echo @arturo182 for the NRF stuff. Looks really cool!

bravodelta 7:50
group hug to everyone for doing HackChat

cater 8:30
group hug, discord is a good break from the forums

dhalbert 8:48
* tannewt for help with usb debugging
* jerryn for awesome testing

jerryn 9:26
* arturo182 for great work on nRF52 + microbuilder
* tdicola for help with rfm69 and esp8266, urequests is huge in memory (later)

kattni 10:40
* awesome discord folks including new folks!
* dhalbert for helping find wireless on new laptop

sigafoos 11:22
* group hug!

sommersoft 11:52
* Just a group hug. And Travis... he's picky, but makes my code better.

arturo182 12:30
Ah I see, big thanks to @jerryn for testing the nRF52840 stuff and for @tannewt for being so cool to a oblivious newcomer

Status 13:06

tannewt:
* Stopped docs and lint work.
* HackChat on Friday went really well
* 2.2.2 coming soon with an ItsyBity fix and a new board.
* Brushed off analogio in 3.x work, got it to compile but doesn't work. Focused on it

tdicola 15:40
* tlc59 led pwm controllers
* mma8451 accel drivers + guide
* si4715 fm transmitter, very troublesome i2c
* si5351 clock gen, worked really well
* cap touch flower guide coming

Deshipu 18:14
* not much free time
* fosdem micropython table which featured his boards, made folks aware of circuitpython
* refactor rgb library, offsets and pixel order, specify it on creation
* work on gamepad module because it has a crash

andon 21:54
Haven't been working on CP stuff. My 3D printer is currently exploded, so that's my project at the moment as I'm upgrading to a dual extruder setup.
Exploded as in disassembled

arturo182 22:26
Since I'm new to CP I want to look more into the code, I printed the docs so I can go through them and see the modules that you offer then I want to see which ones are implemented and which are missing in the nRF port and see what I can do to help there. Can also see which functionality is duplicated by the machine module and could remove that code to keep the code cleaner.

bravodelta 22:40
* nothing

cater 23:20
* nothing, forums

dhalbert 23:36
* trying to work on uart but was context switched.
* made new windows driver release
* included new board definitions

jerryn 25:59
* got first driver submitted SHT31D!
* end of week nRF52 has been awesome!
* featherwing tft works with feather52

kattni 27:47
* cpx project for learn guide. lamp hacking! lots of experimentation on inputs when cpx is in the lamp
* lots of github PR reviews and merges
* helped jerryn with sht31d driver

ladyada 29:18
* I tested out my pIRKey prototypes
* they work great! i submitted a PR for support
* its a generaly purpose Infrared -> HID USB plugin
* we used to sell it! but it was very hard to use
* https://www.adafruit.com/product/1560
* its great for multimedia installs and accessibility
that is in 2.2.2
* right now actually, cachunk!
* ALSO today we're fabbing the itsybitsy m0 express!
* great silkscreen by philb - look for that in the shop by wednesday
* im also thinking about how to do FONA library support
* but will wait for UART in M4 because its very annoying
* and needs a lot of RAM for debugging
* however, FONA can do data so you could use it for internet as well as cellular/SMS

sigafoos 32:50
* PR for lis3dh to change to named tuple
* sick family, :-(
* pinewood derby two weeks ago. cpx on back of one!

sommersoft 34:28
Trellis is ready for bundle; PR coming tonight. Started on USB/REPL connection status issue. USB has a plan. REPL is being particularly obstinate...

Discussion (in the weeds) 35:50
* tdicola, gemma m0. corrupt filesystem while writing a file
    * release notes include troubleshooting link
* 38:18 float/int precision
* 3.0 stalization discussion
