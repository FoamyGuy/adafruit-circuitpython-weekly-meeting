Hug Report for
...Espruino maintainers making available Javascript as an additional language on ESP8266 (multiple languages helps promote physical computing way of working for UK educators)
....Everyone who helped directly/indirectly with me understanding Vlogging - the necessary next step for VGKits Vanguard launch...
- Maintainers of FLOSS Flowblade (editor), Sozi (animation), Xephyr (desktop sizing), SimpleScreenRecorder (desktop recording), LosslessCut (trimming without transcoding)
- Public domain music sharers Kevin MacLeod, Komiku and Sikh Knowledge for intro and background music
- Tdicola for reference Micropython/Circuitpython videos
Any suggestions which other programming/making Youtube channels I should learn from?

CGrover 10:54
* Group hug to those who provide input to learn guides.
* ReadTheDocs great too!

dhalbert 11:21
* jerryneedell for fixing negative temperature measurements in multiple libraries

deshipu 12:05
* I'm grateful for the I2C clock stretching fixes, the RTC clock tuning, and the work on enabling code/data buffering.

jerryn 12:57
* group hug for lots of great stuff
* tannewt for gdb help
* sommersoft for gpio16 work on esp8266

MikeBarela 14:40
* whole community! new so haven't seen the ins and outs

sommersoft 15:08
* @cater, @kattni, @Dan Halbert, & @jerryn for the blitzkrieg on the AM2320/DHT below freezing issue.
* @notro for the RTC addition and refinement.
* And, @Dan Halbert for the updated firmware build guide. Group hug!!

Status Updates 16:00

tannewt 16:23
* Replaced graphics in logo directory with CircuitPython ones.
* PDMIn is converted to register based code and compiles on both but is untested. (Doing that this week.)
* Next are bugfixes to get to Beta

andon 17:53
* Not really! Got the M4, but need to do stuff with it first.

cater 18:17
* bno055 issue. something with bitbangio and clock stretching
* https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_BNO055/issues/9

Have a release 0.1.0 of VGKits vanguard repo, not yet pushed up to https://github.com/vgkits/vanguard
Logo and Graphic Animations through SVG and Sozi to support Vlogging Tweens https://vgkits.org/tmp/logo/text_16_9.sozi.html e.g. blending video tutorials with SVGs like https://github.com/vgkits/vanguard/blob/master/vector/cover.svg
Rendering Desktops for Vlogging (non-standard pixel ratios - e.g. Half 1080p to tile with Two cameras like TonyD) through Xephyr
So so looking forward to merging in demos of Adafruit-Blinka once the VGKits Rainbow kit and vlog launch process is over.

CGrover 21:17
Have an M4 in-hand. Tested it against 3 existing CPy projects. No issues yet. Will probably work on some comparative benchmarks in my project space.
Working on PCB designs: 1) MIDI-DIN interface FeatherWing with integrated DSP-G1 synthesizer chip, designed for Feather M0 Express and CircuitPython.  2) Neuvo LiPo StringCar, ½ size of existing, LiPo charger, Trinket M0 and CircuitPython.  3) Various other PCB bits like LiPo charger breakout w/o USB, a mini DSP-G1 synth breakout (for inserting into an existing MIDI controller keyboard), and a panel-mount dual MIDI-DIN jack breakout with optional logic interface.
Obviously will have to start CircuitPython coding of a bunch of MIDI control code helpers and a custom analog-ish voice catalog now…

dhalbert 22:46
* finished gamepad support. in alpha.6. need game suggestions
* circuitpython build guide without vagrant. linux, mac and Windows subsystem for linux
* SAMD51 cache work. breaks filesystem code but speeds up regular loop code
* tmp36 temp sensor debugging. electrical problem
* cpu.temperature in 3.0. compiled and works on samd21
* discussion on library additions

deshipu 25:30
I'm working on a conference badge for Python conferences that's programmable in CircuitPython. I just got the first pixels displayed, I still need to fix the Python libraries for this, but I'm very happy with how they look. I'm also working on samd51-based version of the µGame handheld game console, for now making an Arduino-compatible shield with a display and buttons to test everything on the Metro M4. I also got the µGame 10 back in stock at Tindie again.

jerryn 26:36
* sticking temp sensors in the freezer. fun! dht sensor bizarre. am2320 is i2c and dht compatible
* stmpe610 driver up. caveat with getting it in the wrong state

kattni 29:23
* fighting with dataloggers
* moved into new machine. still finding stuff to install
* fixed bug in temp sensor libraries
* guide done by Wednesday
* code for next two plots of the week done. one guide page remaining.
* one quick guide with gemma before pycon US. captouch with on board led!
* This weekend is Penguicon! Workshop with CPX. Recorded? Don't think so due to privacy. still photos for blogging

Nothing
Joining Adafruit today
Intro - first full day for Adafruit.
Writing book for MAKE - getting started with CircuitPlayground Express. MakeCode + CircuitPython + Arduino
Retiring from US Department of State. He's very diplomatic :-)

sommersoft 34:22
ESP8266 GPIO16 - Done!

Started looking at SAMD high frequency Pulse in issue. Very likely an execution speed problem as discussed in the issue. Still researching possible alternatives.

Got farther on Windows+Atmel Studio SAMD debugging guide. Have a few more screenshots left to grab, and need to write the details of how to find and view information (breakpoints, traces, etc).

  * LazyGameReviews
  * scanlime - Micah Scott

  * short, punchy tutorials

* dhalbert library placement questions - 39:01
  * arduino map in simpleio
  * calls for better, more accurate clock and timing. anyone know of a python library equivalent.
  * micropython has ticks_ms or
ticks_us
I wonder if it would make sense to have a helper function that simply delays until a certain time passes from its last call
because that's what you usually use those ticks for
sommersoft - Today at 11:47 AM
That would be extending wait_until...but, yeah. Interrupts...
cater - Today at 11:47 AM
isn't that time.sleep()?
deshipu - Today at 11:47 AM
well, I use it for keeping a constant frame rate
@cater not quite, time.sleep sleeps for a certain time, not until certain time passes since the last time
hard to do without callbacks
maybe with await
* jerryn radio weeds
  * trying to use feather combo board. bossa problems. bossa 1.9 is latest but adafruit links to 1.8
  * offer help with radio
* jerryn clock stretching follow up 47:02
  * from deshipu:
    the bitbangio has a copy of code and doesn't use extmod/i2c.c
    well, the fix is that it doesn't use a hardcoded timeout anymore
    but the default timeout should work in most cases
    it's over 250µs
    or to use code from extmod/i2c.h/.c instead of a copy
    we will miss further fixes if we keep using a copy
* Is there any reference information about use of Webrepl in Circuitpython? I have found Adafruit tutorial resources for its use in Micropython 50:00
  * works the same way
  * is support for webrepl mainstream?
