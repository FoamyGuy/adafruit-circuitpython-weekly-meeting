## 8:47 Hug reports
12;44 @brennen
* @cater for picking up chained TLC5947 support after I dropped the ball.
* @kattni for taking on CharLCD library updates.

@cater - lurking, group hug

13:14 @CGrover
* Group hug to the team and community. The help and support are amazing. @kattni’s character display work will be a real time-saver. Wildly anticipating @tannewt’s USB implementation! Also, I appreciate the exposure to advanced topics even though I don’t understand many – yet.

13:42 @dakotahredstone - group hug to all, if any of you have ever written something down, published anything, or created anything and recorded it, thank you. As part of the community, people are trying to learn stuff, and that’s one of the sources when people aren’t on Discord. Gives us something to refer to. I’m a member of a number of communities, some of which are tapering off, and this is one of the few communities that is growing, and I think it’s because of all the little things you do like hug reports. Thank you!

15:28 @danh
* @ktown for BLE discussions.
* @jerryn for thorough testing, especially this week on USB issues.

16:10 @DrewFustini - thank Ladyada for suggesting a better workaround for getting I2C to work on beaglebone.

16:37 @jerryn - Thanks to Scott and Dan for the awesome work on the USB stuff, and continued rapid response to getting it going. Shout out to brentr for TinyLoRa

17:20 @kattni
* @brennen for so much help with getting started updating CharLCD
* Group hug!

9:20 @tannewt
* Thanks to everyone who has tested Alpha 3 so far!
* @mithro for FPGA help
* Ben Shockley for Mini SAM board PR
* Ha Thach for being receptive to TinyUSB changes
* @kattni for library day!

11:15 @Andon
* customary hug report to everyone since you are all awesome.

11:41 @brentr
* Thanks to @jerryn for continued help with testing TinyLoRa.
* @bboser on github for adding a %softreset magic to the Circuit python Jupyter kernel - easier debugging.

11:57 @tg-techie
* My hug report: HUGE hug to the community.  I looked down at my work today and there is no way I could have done this at my current level without python. Your work and standardization has made it so easy and enjoyable to code for controllers. Thank you all so so much.  Happy Thanksgiving to all.

12:22 @ladyada 
* big hug report to tannewt and hathach for a huge usb rewrite
* brennen & kattni for character LCD hackin

## 18:20 Status Updates

22:13 @brennen
* Some assistance last week to @kattni on CharLCD library updates / testing.
* Hacky install script for libgpiod on the Pi / Raspbian.
* Working on libgpiod_pulsein, a small C shim for polling GPIO values on Linux systems.
* Testing TLC5947 chaining.
* Improving Blinka platform detection slightly.
* Out Thursday & Friday.

@cater  - lurking

22:55 @CGrover - 
* Deployed the CircuitPython and Trinket M0 holiday window lights this weekend, although they won’t be activated until after Thanksgiving. Each controller box has its own piezo that plays a fanfare whenever the lights turn on or when they automatically turn off after 6 hours.
* Also tested the front panel and audio output features of the lunchbox music synth (CircuitPython 3.1.1, Feather M0 Express, custom purple PCB). Next steps are to finish testing the analog inputs and outputs, implement the MIDI stack, and tune the default DSP-G1 synth voices. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0NItzSlINU&feature=youtu.be

24:12 @dakotahredstone - most important thing I accomplished, got order in on the NeoTrellis kit, late hug to whoever put together that kit. Doing homework getting up to speed on CircuitPython. 

25:20 @danh
* Merged latest 3.x fixes into master: mainly swapping `.frozen` and `lib/` in `sys.path.
* Revising @arturo182’s bleio code: some API changes, some refactoring.

26:10 @DrewFustini - 
* able to test out some changes that Ladyada suggested for detecting which devices are on I2C bus, resolves issue with beaglebone and not cause regression with similar sensors, looks like that logic now should work. Just pushed commit to my branch of CP busdevice. Comment to see if Scott and Dan could take a look at it, otherwise should be good

27:44 @jerryn - 
* spent way more time than I should have embedding a gemma and accelerometer in a plush hamster so it changes colors when you move it around. Bunch of time playing with bluefruit SPI thing, fun. People ask questions that prompt me to think, that would be fun to do - hooking bluefruit to CPX, it works. iPhone app turns lights on CPX and plays with accelerometer and sensors. Spent some time fixing up rfm69 library to allow user to access radiohead header - means multiple radios and can distinguish between them. Try this week for RFM95. Heading off for Thanksgiving.

29:55 @kattni
* Last week:
   * Library Monday - updated library issue, verified all libs in bundle, released any libs with commits since release.
   * Tested I2C RGB Char LCD shield - turns out lib had no support for it at all.
   * Wrote 74HC595 library, tested, set and merged, still needs PyPI
   * Ended up refactoring the entire library to use MCP230xx and new 74HC595 libraries instead of built-in driver shims.
   * PyPI’d MPL115A2
* This week:
   * Library Monday!
   * Get PR in for Character LCD!!
   * Test LSM9DS0
   * Continue TrellisM4 guide update with NeoPixel toggle demo
   * Will be around for the most part this week and weekend.

33:41 @pink_vampire - 
* Not much status update - didn’t do much programming this week. Been machining. Machined my own soldering iron on a lathe. Stuff like that! https://i.imgur.com/FNnf8V2.png

18:45 @tannewt
* Alpha 3 released last Thursday. Back onto MIDI in TinyUSB
* USB debugging
* Finish MIDI
* Played with FPGAs + LiteX this weekend. Helping with USB softcore on ICE40UP5k
* Around over thanksgiving intermittently.

20:26 @brentr
* Working on a release of TinyLoRa for CircuitPython - began work on this last week after releasing/bugfixing the arduino library. Things Network for CPY! Have most of the hardware classes fleshed out, finished up the AES implementation it requires on Wed. 
   * TODO: Adding message integrity checks (security ftw!), bring it all together, size/speed optimizations (running on a M4 right now) and lots of testing.

21:10 @tg-techie - Walking home. Working on GUI for tricorder, ready to alpha test. Currently only runs on M4, because it’s huge, it should be portable to most peripherals like MPR121 or buttons, if anyone is able to help test, please ping on Discord to help out. 


## 34:50 In the Weeds (Discussion)
* Adding auto_write and show to trellis M4 library
* 36:00 Deleting a module after import
