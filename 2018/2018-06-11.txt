@Andon 8:56
 Group hug! Nothing specific, I've had other things taking my time.

@brentr 9:10
* Mike Teachman for mqtt adafruit io library. https://github.com/MikeTeachman/micropython-adafruit-mqtt-esp8266

* Group hug!

@cefn 10:08
* Aivar Annamaa - Developer of Thonny - doing great experiments with ESP + Integrated Editor/Shell suitable for VGkits Vanguard
* Espressif ESPTool - Being open to accepting PRs for weird uses of the tool + GROUP HUG
* https://bitbucket.org/plas/thonny-esp

@Cgrover 10:57
Group hug to the awesome CPy team. Originally, I could only understand about 10% of the discussions. I’m now up to 20%. Exposure to the technical terms and approaches has helped to spur me to learn more. Focused hugs to @OldCrow for sharing his ModulePlayground work -- has changed my approach to MIDI control message handling for my CircuitPython microsynth project. Also to @JohnPark who provided feedback and patiently endured my obsessed ramblings about the microsynth project and supporting PCBs. More importantly, he gave me some new vectors to pursue regarding the overall approach to music synthesis. I will need a bigger maker budget.

@Dan Halbert 12:01
* Worked on PDMIn bug for 10 days on and off. Ruled lots out but cant fix it. Added code to detect problem and un-hang
* Working on home projects with crickit and assistive tech project
* Will be at boston python meetup

hug reports from dan 13:40

@deshipu 15:25
* group hug! everyone is awesome!

@jepler lurking

@jerryn lurking

@kattni 16:02
* weird bugs this weekend. sommersoft was helpful talking through it
* hug report to dan for helping work through issues
* everyone is great!

MikeBarela 17:16
* 10 points to dan for using correct ameliorate usage
* worth nothing in adafruit store
* dastels, limor has your guide
* writing guide for servos and motors

next week combine hug reports and status updates

nis 19:10
@sommersoft for pointing directly to the list of supported CP boards to a user (I need to start paying attention to README.md files!)
And to the the milieu for keeping me aware of ESP8266 enough to know it's supported in CP.
For the CircuitPython devs who dared to develop this Python very publicly, on Discord. ;)

sdw_nj 19:56
* general kudos to everyone here and micro:bit, micropython and thonny folks

sommersoft 20:27
* just a group hug this week

Status 20:53

@tannewt 21:30
* PulseIn recovery from fast input signal. Had to tweak samd.clock size stuff a bit.
* Visualization of code size done.
* Lots of brainstorming about gaming handheld design and apis
* beta.1 today along with newsletter and then bug hunting for 3.0.0

@andon 23:53
I'm taking a poke at looking into the next version of my DigiBadges, and what I'll need to include a SAMD chip (Likely the 21) for CircuitPython on there. I'll definitely be looking at the super-sizing that  @dastels did a while back.

@brentr 24:43
converting ipython kernel to circuitpython. polishing up carol's work!

@cater 25:20
* nothing new this week

@cefn 25:33
Resolved some screwy behaviours I encountered when testing miniterm on Windows.
This has led to a rollup pull request you can see at https://github.com/pyserial/pyserial/pull/351 which should hopefully fix miniterm for Windows 10 users in general.
Can be tested by installing the vgkits-vanguard tools which already incorporate the fix following https://vgkits.org/blog/vanguard-tools-howto/ and running just 'vanguard shell' which should auto-detect ESP8266 on all platforms.

This week I'll be taking care of William ( see top right corner of https://youtu.be/KJ45g0Bf6x8?t=12s )
Any ideas for cat-entertainer circuits driven by Circuitpython? Thinking servos, PWM beeps, mice appearing, disappearing.

@CGrover 28:27
Mostly PCB revisions over the past week. The Trinket-based Rover family should be done after boards arrive next week, just in time to start looking at the ItsyBitsy/Feather M4 for the next generation of building blocks.
Had a breakthrough regarding the MIDI protocol stack issue I faced two weeks ago when trying to fill CPy lists with verbose MIDI message descriptors. The primary issue was the space consumed by unused and undefined message headers. Woke up this morning and decided to go back to simpler (but still verbose) dictionaries with a non-sequential index, leaving out unused definitions and letting Try – Except handle the missing elements. Duh.
Next week’s plan is to finalize the microsynth code and to assemble the Rover board family with my spankin’ new hot air station. Wish me luck.

@Dan Halbert 29:30
* Worked on PDMIn bug for 10 days on and off. Ruled lots out but cant fix it. Added code to detect problem and un-hang
* Working on home projects with crickit (semaphore adabot) and assistive tech project
* Will be at boston python meetup - 36 gemmas from pycon

@ladyada 42:33
hugs to everyone! kattni for rockin out the CPX guide, its excellent, dan fixing the pdm bug
and of course contributors: carter, cefn, sommersoft, deshipu, CG, jepler, jerryn... more more more i see all the great projects and commits they're awesome :smiley:
blinka_cooking4
update for me is itsy m4 is out, feather m4 on the way
no plans yet on the mega m4
but we'll probably saunter into it some time this month
feather crickit is out
great for feather bots, could be used with m0 xpress or esp8266 for iot bots

@MikeBarela 44:18
* better documentation for motros and servos with circuitpython and crickit.
* guide last week on prepping audio files for circuitpython and the tools you can use to get your audio in that format. want to see more projects with cool audio. never assume the audio off the internet is the exact same format that will work on circuitpython
* everyone is doing great work

@nis 46:27
Studying the uses of the H-Bridge (DRV8833) and trying to learn the heuristics of estimating which loads will be within the constraints of the Crickit at 5 volts --
⁤  trying to learn how to stay within the design goals of the Crickit system (rather than circumventing them).
⁤  Noticed that basically there's one set of four Darlington drivers (as with ULN2003A) which is good for a singleton Unipolar stepper, I think -- and one set of four H-Bridge terminals for the Bipolar stepper.
⁤  Note the easiest way to discern between them is that the one brings out +5V (the Darlington, as it completes the ground by sinking current) and the other (DRV8833) (the H-Bridge) brings out GND as its fifth terminal.
⁤  DRV8833 is available as its own breakout, if you're hunting more documentation.


sdw_nj 51:32
* got through micro:bit tutorial but had feedback that couldn't be incorporated
* wanted to print stand for micro:bit and went to maker space for it

sommersoft 59:39
High Frequency PulseIn: SAMD51 is working with the EIC/EVSYS, though it seems less accurate than SAMD21 in my testing. Maybe DFLL48 related (grasping at straws)?? Have started framework for using COUNT as an alternative, as suggested by @tannewt. Also started reading on nRF timer docs for implementation. Since the High Frequency PulseIn issue was closed, I was thinking of changing the Frequency counter issue to separate out the sensor that is requested into a different issue. < https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/807%3E

Dismantled an old satellite surround speaker, to see if I can use it for a Little Leslie amp using :blinka: and Crikit. Planned to use an Adafruit box, but current speakers are too large. Still early days on this...

Discussion (In the weeds)
* stepper 1:01:15 - avoid steppers and use servo motors. no heat, much faster but a little more expensive. prices nema-23/24 almost the same price. no reason to use steppers
    * https://www.geckodrive.com/g320x.html
