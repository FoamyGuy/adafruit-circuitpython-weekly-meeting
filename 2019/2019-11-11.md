Winterbloom Sol by Alethea Flowers
https://circuitpython.org/board/winterbloom_sol/
Winterbloom Sol is a modular synthesizer (Eurorack) module, and CircuitPython powered! It is a multi-purpose, scriptable USB MIDI to CV/gate converter. Its code can be modified while in use to change how it processes MIDI data into CV and gate outputs. Sol is not yet available for purchase, however, you may contact the creator for more details.

## 30:04 Status Updates
33:20 @brentru
* Last Week
   * Mostly AFK for research/mid-term exam season
      * Been programming in Julia a bunch - interesting language!
* This Week:
   * Catching up with Adafruit IO support channels. 
   * Hoping to finalize a project I’ve been working on for Adafruit.
   * Have some interesting CPY IoT projects/etc in the hopper for after this wraps.


@cater (lurking)


33:50 @CGrover (lurking)
* Past Week:
   * Wrapped up the Stemma 10V Dual 12-bit Eurorack module. It’s a 3HP panel that’s powered by 3.3V Stemma but capable of producing two independent +10V full-scale outputs. https://github.com/CedarGroveStudios/EURO_10V_Dual_12-bit_DAC
   * Completed testing of the standalone Stemma-powered UART adapter for the Classic MIDI FeatherWing so that the wing can be connected to non-Feather devices such as the PyPortal and NeoTrellis M4 via a 3V/5V Stemma or Stemma-QT jack.  https://github.com/CedarGroveStudios/UART-STEMMA_MIDI_Backpack
   * Worked on three submittals for the Hackaday Take Flight With Feather project contest. The Waveform Generator FeatherWing was submitted last week; more to come this week. CircuitPython was used in all three projects.
* This Week:
   * Finish the remaining contest entries then get back to testing the next version of the StringCar M0 Express, the AD9833+ADSR FeatherWing, and the Stemma/Eurorack dual 16-bit DAC boards. Also need to populate a half-dozen more Classic MIDI FeatherWing PCBs for some on-going synth projects. If there’s time, I’ll put the final touches on the StringCar M4 board.
* When it Snows:
   * Need to hack into the LiPo-powered brushless snowthrower to get a better handle on predicting battery usage for various snow depths and wetness. Spare batteries are expensive — don’t want to have more than +1 on hand if possible.


35:36 @charlesburnaford
* It’s interesting you mentioned MIDI, been trying to, don’t know how to describe it, took a resistive touch panel, put an underlay on it with vertical stripes, trying to create a touch device to control MIDI volume and CCs. They have a software version built into sunbox, want to make a hardware version as a separate controller device.


36:42 @danh
* @hathach and I have been specifying BLE services for the Circuit Playground Bluefruit. We will implement these services in both Arduino and CircuitPython. A new Bluefruit Connect app is under development that will use services instead of the Bluefruit Connect UART-based protocol. I did an existence proof for services, testing Scott's new BLE library in the process.
* In the near future, @tannewt and I will review and update the new BLE library, release it, and then release a CircuitPython alpha.6 or beta.0 that is compatible with the new library. The current Learn Guide BLE examples will be updated to use the new API.
* I have done a lot of PR reviewing in the past few days, especially additions to the STM32F4 port being done by @hierophect. Expect to see additional functionality added to the STM32 port in each upcoming CircuitPython release.


@devoh (lurking)


39:44 @Drew Fustini
* Testing out PWMOut on the BBB, already have it merged in for Pocket Beagle, testing Black before creating PR


40:13 @hierophect
* Last week: worked on a variety of bugfixes and minor issues/components now that PWM and UART are wrapping up. Had some interruptions due to local workspace stuff so I’m doubling down this week on getting as many PRs out and wrapped up as possible. 
* This week: major items are any stm32 github issues marked for 5.0, starting with delays and neopixel support, followed by board support. Also need to get into the weeds on stm32 bootloader options to better assist stm32feather newcomers. 


@jasonp (lurking)


41:51 @jepler
* Last week: saying goodbye to coworkers, some of whom I worked with for 20 years
   * I gave out CPXes to anybody who seemed interested in CircuitPython/Adafruit
* This week: taking a little R&R, and putting my home office back together after a carpet install upstairs


42:36 @jerryn
* Last week
   * Back from a week plus of travel - trying to “catch-up” with the new releases.
   * Tested building CP on Raspberry Pi 
      * Found that there is an issue building the spresense BSP
         * mkspk tool does not support ARM 
            * Looks like it will need an upstream fix in the future
      * All other BSPs build fine on RPI 4 Buster or Ubuntu 19.04
      * Still slow even on Pi 4 - but certainly tolerable — ~ 200 seconds per build  (typically 90 seconds on my other systems)
   * PSA - I found that I had to manually update BalenaEtcher on my Mac (Catalina)
      * Not sure when it started to fail, may have been with Catalina, but update fixed it.
   * Tested updated bleio and BLE library - new demos are working well
      * Updated some projects using the Uart Service to use new code.
      * Tried to implement CTS, close, but no cigar ;-)
* This week
   * Continue exploring bleio/BLE 


46:14 @kattni
* Last week:
   * Things are running together and I’m not entirely sure what was finished last week and what was the week before, so apologies for any duplicates.
   * Finished adding the USB-C Micro-LiPo charger to the Micro-LiPo guide, fritzing object created, PCBs on GitHub etc. 
   * Tested the MPR121 HAT on Pi, works as-is with Blinka/CircuitPython, updated guide.
   * Updated the PM2.5 guide to include Python and Blinka usage
   * Started the US100/HC-SR04 guide, tested both on Feather
* This week and beyond:
   * Blog the updated PM2.5 guide
   * Test US100/HC-SR04 on Pi
   * Finish US100/HC-SR04 guide.
   * New guide for mini GPS module
   * Go through PyPI spreadsheet, begin to close it out
   * Go through lingering RTD/PyPI assigned issues on GitHub
   * Circuit Playground Bluefruit library


49:10 @krayola
* Still recovering from a concussion, so minimal screen time.  Would have loved to be spending the mandatory time off work working on circuitpython instead!
* If I am able, I plan to resume working on _pixelbuf


49:42 @MakerMelissa
* Last Week:
   * Finished updating the WS2801 Learn Guide
   * Wrote the SSD1305 displayio Driver
   * Fixed an issue in CircuitPython core displayio with I2C Displays needing reset first
   * Fixed some issues in the Framebuf SSD1305 Driver
   * Finished updating 128x64 SSD1305 Display Guide
   * Worked on sprucing up Gizmo Library Examples
   * Updated Snow Globe code to use Gizmo Library
* Next 2 Weeks:
   * Finish up a TFT Gizmo Slideshow example
   * Work on the remaining SSD1305 guides
   * Hackaday SuperCon Prep which is mostly getting more familiar with the Edge Badge and packing
   * Will leave for SuperCon on Wednesday and arrive back on Tuesday next week
   * Won’t be able to make the next CircuitPython Meeting


51:24 @nis
* I was able complete an Arduino project for STM32F405, using ST's Cube (programmer) or, alternatively, (Debian's distributed) dfu-util (both from a Debian Linux host PC; both via the USB interface).
* Needed to erase all (in Cube, only) to upload to the F405 target, properly.
* (Cube-based) upload was done only outside of the Arduino IDE.
* Used the unpublished F405 Guide to access SPI flashROM on the F405 board (thanks, @jerryn !)
* Guide:
* https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-stm32f405-feather-express
* Cube, script stuff:
* https://termbin.com/je13
* dfu-util CLI syntax:
* dfu-util -a 0 --dfuse-address 0x08000000 -D ./this.bin


@Railo (lurking)


52:11 @siddacious
*  Last Week: Got the LSM6DSOX gyro and accelerometer working in CP and Arduino
*   Finished off the LSM303AGR and MPU-6050 Guides
*   Did some circuit analysis of the droid main board and have a fair idea of how the responsibilities are split between the two modules.
*   Did some initial attempts at flashing blinky, haven't had success yet
*  This Week: more LSM6DSOX features
*   Prepping my laptop to help folks at supercon, testing demos, making sure I have all the dongles, etc.
* trying to do some blinky level tests with my tinyfpga to get familiar with fpga workflows before supercon
* Going to try and get BLE HID working with KMK so I can show off my keypad at supercon
* maybe try to polish off some other projects


59:02 @sommersoft
* Last Week:
   * RosiePi (and her new friend: physaCI [working title])
      * Spent the whole week researching cloud/hosting options to move RosiePi's server off of the RPi.
      * Decided on using Azure using serverless functions, after constructing an architecture that allows for handling a good number of requests per month for less than a dollar. At least I hope; time will tell.
      * Topology/plate-of-spaghetti visual: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1QnK2nmh2eCGIeX_8kLK8-s3RQkcZJII_
      * Allows for multiple RPi "test nodes", which will poll a queue for new jobs.
      * Got to flex my data modeling muscles. They hurt...
      * Skeleton is up; working through GitHub app authentication at the moment...
* This Week:
   * Possibly get back to Actions migration.
      * Finish adabot
      * Start circuitpython-org
   * physaCI
      * Keep working on the Azure integration
      * Hopefully get that done, then start RosiePi code refactor


@stargirl (offline)


30:33 @tannewt
