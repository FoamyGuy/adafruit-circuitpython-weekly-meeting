# CircuitPython Weekly April 1st, 2019

Video is available here [on YouTube](https://youtu.be/FIdXgbQBoLk) and [on diode.zone](https://diode.zone/videos/watch/4945062d-6829-426c-bdc7-ae4b62ba028e)

Thanks to @kattni for taking notes!

Welcome to the meeting notes! Feel free to add your notes for Hug Reports and Status Updates early. We do it as a round robin sorted by username. If you can’t make the meeting, then add them anyway with a “(missing meeting)” after your username and we’ll read them off for you. 

Add any discussion topics or general questions you have to the “In the weeds” section. Thanks! We hope to see you in the meeting.

Join here for the chat all week: http://adafru.it/discord

The weekly happens normally at 2pm ET/11am PT on Mondays. Check the #circuitpython channel for notices of change in time and links to past episodes.

CircuitPython development is sponsored by Adafruit. Please support them by purchasing hardware from adafruit.com.

Reminders: Podcast available on most services. Let us know if we’re missing some.

# 3:30 Community News
HACK CHAT THIS WEEK! Python and the Internet of Things Hack Chat at Hackaday - come join the team and the community this week! The power of Python on microcontrollers - Wednesday, April 3, 2019 12:00pm PDT / 3pm EDT a Hack Chat at hackaday.io! The CircuitPython team from Adafruit (Dan Halbert, Kattni Rembor, Scott Shawcroft, Limor "Ladyada" Fried, and Phillip Torrone) will be hosting the Hack Chat on Wednesday, April 3, 2019 at noon PDT / 3pm EDT - https://hackaday.io/event/164062-python-and-the-internet-of-things-hack-chat 

CIRCUITPYTHON ON CALCS! The TI planet community got CircuitPython boards running on their TI-83 Premium CE calculators - https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/03/31/use-circuitpython-boards-on-the-ti-83-premium-ce-calculator-tiplanetnews-ticalculators-circuitpython-circuitpython/ 

MU ALPHA - Mu 1.1.0-alpha.1 was released and the feedback has been excellent, stop by gitter and/or the issues on GitHub to see the latest - https://gitter.im/mu-editor/general 

6:10 Circuitpython.org ! /downloads is looking good, thanks Dan, Scott, Sommersoft for reviewing the PRs - https://www.circuitpython.org/downloads we can add features of boards, we do need to make sure we do not add too many, so let’s chat about which ones make sense, so far we have: Wifi, speaker, light sensor, temp sensor, there is a PR for battery charging.

# 29:17 Status Updates

32:53 @brentr
* Last Week
   * PyPortal Smart Scale
      * Hacked apart a Dymo Scale and internet-ified it!
         * What does this mean? We added a new Circuit python library so you can easily interface with an off-the-shelf postage scale with Circuit python and dropped in Adafruit IO CircuitPython to send scale data over-the-net
      * Guide early this week
   * Ongoing work on new IO API Documentation
      * Almost finished with code snippets
      * Started to add a “cookbook” page, similar to how CPython’s logger module has a cookbook. 
         * If you have any ideas or “recipes” for the cookbook, let me know in #help-with-adafruit-io
* This week
   * Guide work: PyPortal Smart Lighting Controller for Smart WiFi Bulbs!
   * Further work on the IO API Documentation

* To-Date: Took a break from CircuitPython to work on a couple of Eurorack module kits. Was nice to focus on therapeutic through-hole soldering again. Walked through some fun PyPortal projects, too.
* Returned to CircuitPython this weekend to finish a collection of fundamental MIDI note utilities. The helpers translate a note descriptor string ’C#5’ to a note value (0 to 127), note values to a descriptor string, and a single helper that combines the two translators to permit “free-form” entry of either input form (note-to-name; name-to-note). I also threw in two more helpers for note-to-frequency and frequency-to-note calculations. https://github.com/CedarGroveStudios/MIDI_Util
* To-Do: Next on the list is to complete one more rack module kit (mostly SMD soldering – fun, but not as therapeutic as through-hole) and do some CircuitPython coding. 
* Expect to wrap up a MIDI message decoder library using the full (memory-hungry) standard protocol stack and an optional lower-calorie version for essential messages. The decoder will include filters and triggers so that only certain messages or sequences are decoded -- as an option to the default mode of processing all messages. Would be handy to be able to isolate or ignore a System Exclusive message block, for example. The decoder is the essential algorithm for analyzing received messages and will first be used in a 2nd-generation portable MIDI signal sniffer. With some tweaking, the decoder will also form the foundation of a general-purpose message builder for transmitting MIDI message sequences. Big thanks to the authors of “Data Structures and Algorithms in Python” for helping me achieve an enlightened approach to transforming the MIDI protocol into a Python-digestible structure. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1118290275

Adafruitdaily.com to sign up, entirely spam-free. If you want to get this week’s newsletter, go to https://adafruitdaily.com to sign up.


49:33 @Noe
* 2.13in Eink featherwing stand
   * Circuit Python demo code
   * [Issued bug in library repo](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_EPD/issues/11)
   * [Link to product page](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4128)
* Learn guide in progress for PropMaker Keyblade (code by Kattni)


50:17 @sdw_nj
* Did some various research on sigrok documentation - there is support for the multimeter in libsigrok, went looking for it. Decided to look again for the datasheet - found it for the second time (was already bookmarked). 4 pages of transmission spec. Figure out how to decode it. Doesn’t send data, sends state of LCD.


53:38 @siddacious
* Leaving previous job last week.
* Sent off a board for the STLPS35HW - water resistant mems sensor
* This week INA260 product guide
* Moving onto drivers for new board
* Start working on board BD3491FS sound processor with built-in surround function, basically mixer chip


54:56 @sommersoft
* Last Week:
   * nRF PDMIn: Changed buffer management to use a "static" double buffer in PDMIn.c for 2 reasons. 1) to test if my previous buffer management using the object's buffer was the reason for unusable output, and 2) to enable more inline manipulation for things like 8-bit samples (nRF periph is 16-bit only). The buffer switch caused no change for #1, so I took a break to complete some edX coursework on C pointers; wanted to make sure my shaky understanding wasn't the cause.
   * adabot "updated libraries" list: started formulating a plan for this. 
* This Week:
   * PDMIn: Will start to implement the sinc filter to see if it fixes the output data.


29:42 @tannewt
* Fixed HID bug that was causing CircuitPython to crash.
* Finished the release of Beta 6 and wrote script to format BBCode and HTML from release Markdown.

* Previous week: Moved Glyph and BuiltInFont into fontio
* Fix setting RGB brightness to be immediate.
* Fix CDC OUT (into circuitpython) buffer so that it doesn’t overwrite.
* This week: bug hunting filesystem issues. Trying to get us to rc.0.
* HackChat on Wednesday
* Having lunch with Greg from Lattice on Wednesday as well

# In the weeds
56:27 @siddacious - For the CP.org downloads page, opened a PR to have something where you can tell the features for a board, what I had in mind was somewhere in RTD there was a matrix of which boards supported which built-in libraries, don’t know where this would be useful, maybe advanced search?


# 59:17 Wrap-up
