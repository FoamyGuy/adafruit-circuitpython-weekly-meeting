29:11 @charlesburnaford
* Interesting thing I did: cobbled together using CP and a barometric pressure sensor, quick and dirty datalogger to see what was going on in the area as far as the storm is concerned. Didn’t bother to take a pic, CP made it super simple


29:57 @danh
* @hathach found the cause of BLE HID not working on iOS: fixed.
* Finished BLE PR’s: latest code is in 5.0.0-alpha.1 and Adafruit_CircuitPython_BLE library: `bleio` is now `_bleio`, many additions and changes.
* Debugged on-board DotStar problem on PyRuler: fixed in 4.x and master
* Prepared and released 5.0.0-alpha.1.
* Next up: BLE bonding.


@Dave Briccetti
* (lurking)


@DaveP (lurking)


32:09 @Heirophect
* Not too many updates, got caught up in moving craziness that took longer than hoping
* Moving on rapidfire action items: PR for USB setup and modularity setups for STM boards, rapidly moving through analogio, busio, QSPI to begin STM32 port.


33:08 @jepler
Last week:
* Checked whether any existing audio DMA bugs were fixed by DMA tracking #2019 
   * Unfortunately, NO :-(
* Investigated M4 stereo audio synchronization issue #1992 extensively.  I believe the problem is clock setup, and have an improvement in #2104.  There’s still weirdness, though, and Arduino doesn’t have these problems.
   * My branch seems to also mess up reading the qspi flash, more work to do
* Investigation of #1992 also led to filing #2099, in which stereo audio doesn’t work right when playing from a WaveFile either, but different symptoms than #1992


This week:
* Starting I2S audio out on nRF
* Will back-burner #1992 / #2104 until I2S out is done, but when I get back to it, I will further compare clocking and DAC registers between Arduino and CP


34:38 @jerryn (not able to attend -- off in a canoe)
* Updated ESP_ATcontrol library 
   * Now uses adafruit_requests and works with AdafuIO http library
      * Hope to get miniMQTT working soon.
* Fixed LIS3DH library to access ADC.
   * Not overly useful, but it works now
* Found/fixed CP5 compatibility issue in Slideshow library.
* Tested BLE updates with CP5 Alpha.1 -- working well.


35:16 @kattni
* Last week:
   * Updated PDM mic breakout guide to include CircuitPython and the PDM mic with JST breakout - fritzing object etc.
   * Wrote product guide for ATECC608 - fritzing object etc.
   * Discussed update to adabot with @sommersoft to better track open PRs and issues across the libraries.
   * Worked through how to better utilise circuitpython.org/libraries/contributing for what it was intended for - plan is to change up where it’s pulling the data from so it can be built daily to use to track PRs/issues.
   * Created a @community helpers role and brought on two community members as Community Helpers. - If anyone has any suggestions of community members for consideration, please contact me on Discord privately. The role is intended to be a way to recognise those who are putting a lot of effort into embodying what we’re trying to do with creating a supportive and positive community, and who help out across the entire server. Please keep this in mind when suggesting someone. This role does mean they are making themselves more available to the community in a more visible manner, as the role is explained as pingable for assistance, so it may not be for everyone. Obviously inclusion is ultimately up to the community member.
* This week:
   * Update CP FAQ/Troubleshooting to reflect dropping 2.x/3.x bundles
      * Merge PR to finalise removal once guide is updated
   * Give libs a quick sweep for issues/PRs.
   * Product guide for Circuit Playground Bluefruit.
   * Make a decision on Circuit Playground Express library - definitely going with `.bluefruit` module, still considering import manner. 
   * Update a series of old libs that were created before we standardised cookiecutter.
   * Possibly work with @sommersoft on the adabot updates (depending on his schedule)
   * Work with Justin on updating cp.org/libraries and /libraries/contributing


@kingernorth (lurking)


@40:35 @MakerMelissa
* Last Week:
   * Worked on finishing up TensorFlow install procedure for Raspberry Pi and writing guide
   * Worked on testing some eInk PRs
   * Updated Display Buttons to be a subclass of a group.
* This Week:
   * Finish up TF Raspberry Pi guide
   * Finish up Testing eInk PRs
   * Get back to working on some Blinka stuff (guides, new boards, PRs, etc.)


@mikeb (lurking)


26:26 @ntoll
* Yesterday started new utility called circup, tool that allows folks to update the modules on their connected devices, (circuitpython update). Going well, still in the dark on some things, and after 10 minutes it all becomes clear, hack around it etc.
* CLI utility, hopefully finished by end of the week.
* Please comment and make suggestions!


41:24 @siddacious


* Bitsy Airlift Add on guide waiting for final pics
* Finished CP TLV493D driver
* Started another complete re-route of my keypad for the 3rd time after waffling on design decisions and finding no native support for high speed 8-bit parallel on NRF
* Working on: TLV guide
* PCT 2075 bringup, testing, drivers, guide
* More keypad routing to come:
http://prntscr.com/p1clph




44:11 @sommersoft
   * Last Week:
   * Mixer
   * Finished using of all the available ARMv7M (M4) intrinsic math functions.
   * Disabled Mixer on all M0 boards. This may change in the future, if the C code can be slimmed down enough.
   * Made Mixer backwards compatible with `audioio.Mixer`, when `audiomixer` is available.
   * Core Docs: fixed the CSS overrides, so that text is wrapped in tables on RTD.
   * This Week:
   * Mixer
   * Address any comments from another round of review.
   * Re-word the docstring and/or change the `channel_count` param.
   * Library Issue/PR Metrics:
   * Get the necessary logic into adabot to:
   * Calculate time deltas.
   * Check for labels available & assigned.
   * Work with @kattni & @justin to move circuitpython.org/libraries updates to AWS S3, so that the update interval can be increased without requiring more "touch time" (PR approval/merge).


23:38 @tannewt
Last week:
   * Swapped us over to GitHub Actions for CI. Nothing super bad/broken. Not all release assets were uploaded.
   * Added Hallowing M4 board def.
   * Added writeto_then_readfrom. Should be used instead for stop=False.
   * New refresh API, Monster M4SK and ePaper support merged! Wait_for_frame and refresh_soon should be optional in 4.x so they can simply be removed from examples.
   * Had good discussions/interest at PAX. Connected with a Playdate dev who clarified it’d be “fairly open”. One private flash bank and one for games likely.


This week:
   * Need to fix I2CDisplay, swap API token for release uploads and then release Alpha 2.
   * Finish adding .hidden to Group and TileGrid.
   * Get BLE Image transfer demos going and work from there.


## 48:07 In the Weeds


48:40 @siddacious: Where are we in regards to concurrency? I’ve been trying to not describe state machines to a guy who wants to blink neopixels and take input.
   * DanH: We want to get there, but it’s not imminent. gamepad for buttons. 

51:52 Also maybe more on NRF Parallel


53:13 @charlesburnaford Extension of similar problem: how to catch keypresses and releases in midi keyboard with a gpio expander.


54:40 @Dave Briccetti (from text):
   * Hi all. I won’t be fully on the call today, but I want to throw out an idea about a directory of the CircuitPython community. Maybe an online spreadsheet with: who’s working on what, relationship to Adafruit, general bio, professional and personal, twitter handle, YouTube channel, LinkedIn profile and the like, geographical location. Opt-in, community-maintained. To help a newcomer like me get oriented and make connections for collaborating, contributing, and the like.


1:11:00 @cater
* NeoPixel related:
    * remove bpp? Moving to pixelbuf
    * 1:15:01 is the automagic white channel thing good?
        * tuple versus number.
    * RGBW control with an int


58:35 @jepler
Do we ever deprecate/remove old boards?  Will M0s be “too small” for CP7.x?
   * We have, but continuing support for M0 is ideal.
   * Discussion of other languages too. (danh notes here) Some languages (not just ideographic ones) have larger translations. We can use various strategies to ameliorate this:
   * Better compression (LZW or similar with shared dictionary)
   * Use hiragana and other phonetic alphabets for ideographic languages
   * Offload large translations into CIRCUITPY filesystem or SPI flash in general
   * Remove terminalio support on board builds with large languages 


## Wrap-up
