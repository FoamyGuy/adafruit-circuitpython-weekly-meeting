39:15 @CGrover
* Tried to run some performance sensitive midi sniffing, PyGamer is doing great at that
* Decided to try some performance-sensitive MIDI sniffer code on the PyPortal and PyGamer. The PyGamer was display was much faster than the PyPortal and will suffice for my portable MIDI Sniffer. Here’s the video of the PyGamer test: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYYQphkxNUA
* The PyGamer and PyBadge are excellent candidates for standalone, portable projects where the front panel is already included.
* This week will focus on wrapping up the Stemma 16-bit DAC project, mini 10-volt boost breakout, and a bunch of MIDI projects. Two board designs will be heading to OSH Park later this week. One is a FeatherWing that can be used to provide STEMMA and STEMMA-QT connectors to existing Feathers and FeatherWings.


* Just discovered how to output MIDI from my DAW to the Eurorack setup, so I’m sure that will be a huge distraction this week. Imagining sweetening some existing recordings with synth sounds from the rack, all synchronized to the existing live tracks. It’s like having a step sequencer of unlimited length, infinitely programmable tempo, and with an unlimited number of voice channels. So many possibilities!


41:08 @dcbriccetti (Dave Briccetti)
* Last week
   * Wrote the CPX to p5.js application I mentioned last week to control launching simulated balls into the sky using the accelerometer
      * I don’t yet have a way to reliably read serial data from the CPX. I’ve been using pyserial. The error I get is serial.serialutil.SerialException: read failed: device reports readiness to read but returned no data (device disconnected or multiple access on port?)
   * Submitted an example mapping accelerometer data to NeoPixel colors. @kattni helped me polish it, and merged it.
   * Wrote a new example, Gravity Pulls Pixel, which may or may not be suitable as a simple example

43:15 @danh (offline)
* Enhanced BLE descriptor functionality. Added specification of permissions and length information for characteristics and descriptors. Internal refactoring. This is all in support of BLE HID. Initial implementation of Python HID library now being debugged. 


43:39 @deshipu
* PewPew badges for a Polish conference are in production
* PewPew M4 (aka µGame Turbo) is progressing, got custom bootloader and a new version with a laser-cut case will arrive on Wednesday
* Might look into sound support for Stage on MicroPython ESP32 port this week


@fede2 (lurking)


45:12 @hierophect
* Past couple weeks been consolidating the STM32 port, making sure both boards are working consistently, busio working, getting full flash support in the next few days over USB
* Finishing up busio and analogio for STM32
* Documenting the process to get the port to this point so future ports will have an easier time getting there


@jasonp (lurking)


46:55 @jepler
* Got to chase a fun SAMD audio bug
* Plan to chase a reported pyportal crash when hardware arrived
* Signed up for github “actions” beta, on waiting list.  Will work on CI when that comes though.
* Shilling for (circuit)python on metafilter, got a modest positive response: https://www.metafilter.com/182499/PyOhio-2019#inline-7762734


47:56 @jerryn
* Stumbled across a few issues
   * Keyboard HID broken in 5.0 -- now fixed
   * PyPortal soft reboot goes to Safe mode after certain programs.
      * Something about soft reboot
      * Damaged one Pyportal trying to hand solder SWD connector
         * Ordered hot air station...
* Ran some tests of new BLE on a few different nRF52840 boards - no issues other than my confusion…
* Got a new weed-whacker!


25:42 @kattni
* Last two weeks:
   * Was out Monday-Wednesday two weeks ago
   * Out Monday last week
* Two weeks ago: 
   * PyRuler guide and fritzing object
* Last week: 
   * Guides and fritzing objects for:
      * 1.3”, 1.54”, 2.0” IPS TFT LCDs
   * Fixed issue with fab print for Ultimate GPS USB in guide
   * Started work on / routed TLV493D
* This week:
   * Finish up work on TLV493D
   * Remake uPython OLED watch in CircuitPython
   * MintyLinty guide
   * Go through all the CircuitPython board guides and make sure they’re all pointed at the right CircuitPython versions and so on.


28:40 @krayola
* Unable to make meeting but want to provide a status update:
   * Worked on _pixelbuf to make it use strings for byteorder configuration, like pypixelbuf instead of classes.  This freed up some flash space.
   * Managed to get adafruit_dotstar.py and neopixel.py working with the _pixelbuf API changes, but still need to push to a fork and test when frozen in.
   * Performance gains using _pixelbuf are very noticeable!
   * Managed to squash most bugs but still have testing to go.
* Hopefully this coming week:
   * Have some PR feedback to address.
   * Get adafruit_dotstar.py and neopixel.py compatible with the newer _pixelbuf pushed.
   * Test frozen in neopixel.py


29:26 @MakerMelissa
* Last Week:
   * Completed code sections for 1.3”, 1.54”, and 2.0” IPS TFT LCD Guides
   * Finished up the rest of the Shield and Feather display guides
   * Updated Arduino Examples for new Displays
* This Week:
   * Work on the breakout board guides


30:08 @MikeBarela
* Have been working on some CP stuff behind the scenes, doing Python on Hardware newsletter work, editing, organizing, and making the content pretty
* If you like CircuitPython and Python on Microcontrollers stuff, subscribe!
* Updating the slideshow library to use displayio, working on a guide to use the updated version which should be out soon.


@mr certainly (lurking)


33:18 @siddacious
* Designed a few new stemma qt boards, more coming down the pike
* Finally debugged the OLED bonnet
* Started wiring the house with neopixels, BLE and Airlifts
* Working more boards through the pipeline
* Testing a Rev B of the Airlift BitsyWing and a QT’d sensor


34:48 @sommersoft (text only)
* Last Week:
   * MixerVoice
      * Non-DSP Capable (M0):
         * Got 8bit unsigned & 16bit signed mixing and level (gain) working.
      * DSP Capable (M4):
         * Started working on 8bit unsigned. ASM is difficult.
* This Week:
   * MixerVoice:
      * Keep pushing on DSP 8bit unsigned.


35:17 @tannewt
* Was in NYC last week and mostly streamed and chatted with folks.
* Will wrap up busio.I2C stop= work this week. Lots of PRs incoming this week to remove stop= use
* Hope to wrap up ePaper/refresh work as well
* Plan on switching CircuitPython to GitHub Actions CI/CD once we can opt into the latest version which uses yml syntax. Should be the next couple of weeks. 60 concurrent so one job per board.
* Giving a presentation to Puget Sound Programming Python (PuPPy) on Wednesday evening. Modified version of Teardown talk.


## 50:00 In The Weeds

50:45 @jepler - “fully reinitialize”, including initial filesystem contents (main.py)
* This is on my mind because @FondsofFall was having trouble getting back to a working Trells M4 over on the help channel
* The benefits I see are
   * by scripting it, it is repeatable,
   * by providing a "fully reinitialize" option, it might help some users, and
   * once done, it's easy for anyone with git to find out "what was shipped with board B in release R".
   * For board manufacturers, it might remove one step from their workflow (not sure how this is typically being done now)
* On the other hand, 
   * some users will accidentally use "fully reinitialize" and lose their own code,
   * this doubles the number of build artifacts again, and
   * it's a fair bit of work to do this for each supported board (initial infrastructure in circuitpython.git, source the file(s), add to git, etc)
* To that end, I've written an alpha-quality program in C which uses oofatfs to produce a filesystem image containing the usual circuitpython meta-files like .fseventsd:  mkfatimg
* From @kattni: we have a non-fully populated repo that is supposed to have the shipping code from the various devices. Good idea but may have some potential downsides
* @tannewt: good idea but worries about users deleting their code by accident; @jepler agrees
   * It’s likely we’ll want to also add QSPI flashing capability to the UF2 bootloader
   * Agrees @jepler is on the right track but we need to get the shipping code more organized first
* @kattni: maybe we should check in example code to the guide repo so it can be inlined into the guide. Will give this more thought and ping @jepler about how to move forward


58:33 @sommersoft
* MixerVoice: there are currently functions/stubs for 8bit signed & 16bit unsigned source formats. To my knowledge, these are quite rare. `WaveFile` doesn't even support them. Should they be supported, or dropped?
   * @jepler says dropped; the signed-ness is implied from the bit-depth so having both would screw things up. @tannewt agrees


59:36 @deshipu
* How hard would it be to read the bootloader configuration from UF2? Could we use that to automatically initialize displayio/i2c/spi? https://github.com/Microsoft/uf2/blob/master/cf2.md 
* Could we make a pure CP lib to read this code or would it need a C helper?
* @tannewt: wouldn’t be against a way to add code to CP to allow people to read bytes. Writing would be more dangerous. Worth looking at but we’ll probably still want to have our own board defs for different pin names and other things


1:04:19 @hierophect
* Wondering about the existing obstacles to low power functionality, as I’ve had a lot of questions about that from both beginners/vets in my area who are hoping to create battery-run devices/sensors/etc, particularly given the upcoming e-paper support which is ideal for low-power or hibernating applications. This is related to the absence of interrupts to use for wakeup, correct? 
* @tannewt it’s a bit tricky of figuring out when it’s ok to sleep because CP will do things in the background for you. How do we handle sleeping when this is happening. It’s worth working on but it’s hard.
* @hierophect: would resume be hard to do well?
   * @tannewt: saving memory state and resuming would be tricky
* @deshipu; hard sleep, would be easier. Actually would be a stop, not a sleep
* @tannewt is happy to see someone work on this but would personally prefer to put his time to making `time.sleep` actually sleep
