* @jepler for filling in the gaps for the circuitplayground ble
* @jerryn for the debugging of the purple led mystery
## 25:05 Status Updates


28:38 @brentru
* Completed work on Google Cloud Core IoT for Circuit python 
* Built out a JWT library this past Thurs/Fri to support JSON-Web-Token authentication 
* As a result of work on GCS, Iâ€™ve been making CircuitPython MiniMQTT a solid MQTT client..
   * Network management improvements - sockets and the network manager are handed in a more intelligent way, blocking loop updated to handle the network manager.
   * Control loop improvements - Both loops (blocking and nonblocking) handle the keepalive value with a timer/timeout, pingreq/pingresp added to loops to prevent disconnection from server. 
   * CONNECT packet creation was refactored to support long client identifiers and passwords - added the remaining-length algorithm described in the MQTT specification. 
* Starting to release all the components early this week (Mon/Tue):
   * CircuitPython RSA Module
   * CircuitPython JWT (JSON Web Token) module
   * CircuitPython GCS IoT Core Module
      * Guide about GCS IoT later this week

* BLE PRâ€™s revised and merged after reviews by @tannewt.
* Reviewed and merged several PRâ€™s by @jepler and @tannewt.
* Board definition for Circuit Playground Bluefruit.
* Made GPIO-based touchio originally developed for nRF available on SAMD51. Now all CircuitPython boards can have touchio.
* Increased number of Travis job to shorten build times after it increased due to new optimization for nRF builds
* To do: Debug BLE HID, implement bonding


33:17 @Dave Briccetti
* Wanting to add simulated momentum to the imaginary object represented by the NeoPixel in our example, Gravity Pulls Pixel. Iâ€™m thinking maybe pendulum physics formulas is the way to go.
* This Wednesday my grades 6â€“8 students at a private school where I teach part time will start with CPX. Weâ€™ll start with MakeCode, and then Iâ€™ll encourage them (especially the older grades) to apply the Python skills they developed last year and use CircuitPython. 


34:37 @deshipu
* Prototype number 4 for PewPew M4


36:07 @jepler
* Thanks to @kattni, Iâ€™ve been promoted to CircuitLibrarian
* nRF PDMIn quickly reached a PRâ€™able state, but some additional work / re-work anticipated.  Weâ€™re having a `make check-translate` problem that I donâ€™t understand yet.
* While doing PDMIn, found a bug with PWMAudioOut always looping RawSamples
* Small, simple fixes for several other issues
* Contributed several reviews
* Working on upstreaming the namedtuple bugfix to micropython
* PyRuler project: USB HID device to control my media player, digital picture frame, and a wifi-addressable lamp.  Status: Done, but the tape-over key legends keep coming loose


38:33 @jerryn (missing meeting)
* Trying to understand why the PyRuler DotStar comes up solid magenta instead of pulsing green â€¦ good excuse to get J-link hooked up and remember how to use it.
   * Still a WIP
* Spent a lot of time chasing what seemed to be a similar DotStar issue on Gemma_M0 but it appears to have been an isolated HW issue on one boardâ€¦..
* Found odd issue with VEML4040 i2c on nRF52840s but it appears to be isolated to the VEML4040 and VEML7700 and not a generic I2C issue.
* This week -- just keep breaking stuff ...


39:29 @josh (text only)
* This week Iâ€™ve been working on an offline version of EduBlocks as itâ€™s been heavily requested by multiple people. For now, Iâ€™ve only got it working on Linux + Raspberry Pi & Hopefully Windows + Mac when I learn how to do installers for them. Itâ€™ll include offline support for CircuitPython so you can code your CircuitPython compatible devices in block format without having internet.


40:05 @kattni
* Last week:
   * Started redoing uPython Watch guide in CircuitPython, immediately ran into bug in CircuitPython with I2C and OLEDs. Put that on hold.
   * Assembled OLED watch stacking assemblies (Feather M4, DS3231 FeatherWing, OLED FeatherWing)
   * Started looking into linting guide.
   * Tested bug fix for CircuitPython, I2C and OLEDs.
   * Completed code for CircuitPython OLED Watch.
   * Started CircuitPython code page in OLED Watch guide.
   * Setup Windows VM.
* This week:
   * Finish CircuitPython page in OLED guide (contingent on 5.0 release)
   * Start linting guide 
   * Update the CP Libs issue in CircuitPython issues list to point to circuitpython.org
   * Make note of how to use joystick_x/y.value to find analog joystick data on PyGamer somewhere in PyGamer guide - Essentials guide
   * Begin sorting out how to better track library PRs and issues
      * Consistent follow through needed 
      * Needs to be multiple people involved
      * Update Adabot to better facilitate this
      * Discuss with @sommersoft how best to go about updating Adabot
   * Hopefully setting up replacement new laptop (the first one GPU failed, had to be returned)


@kingernorth (lurking)


44:48 @MakerMelissa
* Last Week:
   * Finished updating the remainder of the display guides (11, I think) with a displayio section
   * Did some Blinka testing on the Jetson Nano
   * Started on a new Adafruit IO MessagePanel guide
   * Updated Display Text PyPortal example to work on latest stable build
* This Week:
   * Finish Message Panel Guide
   * Start working on a guide for getting TensorFlow running on the Raspberry Pi 4
   * Anything else that comes up


45:45 @sommersoft (not in meeting)
* Last Week:
   * MixerVoice
      * Non-DSP v DSP Capable Functions:
         * At @jepler's suggestion, I've dropped efforts to accomplish/fix non-working ASM/DSP functions in favor of using C functions. My ears & eyes cannot discern any lag in using the C functions compared to the ASM.
      * 8-bit signed/16-bit unsigned:
         * Last week I asked about not supporting these formats, which received agreement. During our conversation, @jepler also pointed out that RawSample allows both of these formats.
         * Worked through some test scripts for this, and the functions seem to be working properly on an M4. Need to test on M0. Then should have a PR in.
   * Circuitpython-build-tools
      * Fixed a bundling issue with an examples subfolder containing the word "examples" in the name (e.g. "examples/advanced_examples"). Basically, the subfolder path would be truncated when building the path tree, causing the bundle/zip functions to cough up a NotFoundError.
* This Week:
   * MixerVoice


47:12 @tammymakesthings (not in meeting)
* Working on a script to automatically update CircuitPython devices with the latest .uf2 and latest libraries (more details to come)


25:30 @tannewt
* Finishing EPaper work and refresh rework
* Finishing switching to GitHub CI
* Finish stop=
* Group hide and show


## 47:43 In the Weeds

* 48:14 @danh- more 4.x releases with new features?
   * binascii and hashlib for RSA for IoT
   * HID custom descriptor for @ATMakersBill
* 58:03 @tannewt - Breaking changes and backwards compatibility: https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/2068
* 1:13:40 @kattni - Lib bundle builds question.
