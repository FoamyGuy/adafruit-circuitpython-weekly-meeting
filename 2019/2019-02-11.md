* Next project, PCB designs around instance lib. Eurorack control voltage and scaling module


40:10 @charlesburnaford
* Experimenting with NeoTrellis for purposes of doing a autoharp type thing. Got it partially working - major and minor chords. Need to add other stuff. Strumming next. Air harp based.


41:39 @danh
* Just kibitzed on some issues due to vacation. Now back and will be finishing off some remaining bugs for 4.0.0, then adding more BLE functionality, perhaps BLE HID.


@dastels - lurking


42:38 @jerryn
* Took some time to play with particle mesh - non CP but lots of fun!
* Responded to a discord question, found/fixed a bug in the tinylora lib when large packets sent.
* Continued using BLE with crickit and Bluefruit Connect -- great combination
* Began testing ESP32SPI library -- great start
* Next week -- keep poking/prodding  in general Especially ESP32SPI.




21:36 @kattni
* Last week:
   * ADXL343 fritzing object created.
   * 2.13” tri-color eInk fritzing object created.
   * Started update to eink guide
   * Finalised the ADT7410 guide.
   * Ported MotorKit examples from the Python_Motor lib.
   * My VCNL4040 boards came in! 
   * Driver with basic functionality working!!
   * Updated `register` to work with multi-byte registers
   * Built a breadboard harness for my Saleae
   * Found a bug with the `register` update
* This week:
   * Continue/complete driver for VCNL4040.
   * Next up: VEML7700 driver
   * Verify that my fix for the `register` bug is correct, push fix.
   * Finish updating eink guide with 2.13” display, 2.7” display
   * Finish up Getting Started with CP and BLE guide
   * Write Prop-Maker FeatherWing Battle Axe code for Noe and Pedro
   * Bundle/PyPI ESP32SPI

   * At some point:
      * Update CPX lib to remove 2.x compatibility
      * Finalise ServoKit guides


25:21 @MakerMelissa
* Last Week:
   * Worked on Neopixel FeatherWing Library
   * 7-Segment Display FeatherWing Library finished
   * Did a bunch of reviews
   * Fixed a couple issues with HT16K33 Library
   * Started writing my first Learn Guide
* Next Week:
   * More library work
   * More work on the Guide
   * Moving, so lots of packing


@mikebarela - lurking


@Mr Certainly - lurking


26:51 @sdw_nj 
* Job at microcenter!
* Project: bought multimeter, has cables for USB & DB9 serial, only has windows software, trying to come up with something in Python that works cross platform
* Possibly make a CircuitPython mobile data logger that you could hook up to record
* One feature is graph over time
* Long term thing


28:00 @siddacious
* Last week - Guide published *wew!*, JPEG work/exploration
* This week- Working on JPEG decoding and board assembly (if it arrives)


29:18 @sommersoft
* Last Week:
   * circuitpython-build-tools:
      * Added `font5x8.bin` to library bundles for `adafruit_framebuf`.
   * adabot:
      * Just remained confused at how temperamental Travis is being. crons have now passed, but it doesn't appear to be related to any changes to adabot. :shrug:
   * FrequencyIn: 
      * Added user configurable `capture_period` attribute. Has 1ms - 500ms range for now; will decide minimum and maximum after more testing.
      * Removed EIC latency adjustment, and simplified the math. Hoping this allows me to approach adjustment from a fresh perspective. Getting about 10% fluctuation in readings from a min/max perspective. This is mostly the variation in the capture period, not EIC latency, since the period can be up to 900us beyond the set capture period. Note: I finally did the math on EIC latency; even with a 48MHz clock (GCLK_EIC), latency per event is in the nanosecond range.
* This Week:
   * FrequencyIn
      * Adding event counter overflow handling. Increases possible max frequency capability, so that `131,070` (65,535*2) events are possible. This will aid longer capture_periods.
   * adabot:
      * Work on newline issue for Google Docs transcription


31:05 @tannewt
* A variety of displayio improvements
        * Introduces BuiltinFont and Glyph so the built in font can be used by libraries. For boards with a font it is available as board.TERMINAL_FONT. Fixes #1172
        
        * Remove _load_row from Bitmap in favor of bitmap[] access. Index can be x/y tuple or overall index. Fixes #1191
        
        * Add width and height properties to Bitmap.
        
        * Add insert and [] access to Group. Fixes #1518
        
        * Add index param to pop on Group.
        
        * Terminal no longer takes unicode character info. It takes a BuiltinFont instead.
        
        * Fix Terminal's handling of [###D vt100 commands used when up arrowing into repl history.
        
        * Add x and y positions to Group plus fixes.


34:05 @tg-techie
* Long term - working on GUI, 14 days, done. 
* Fixed white space breaking of font
* Try to release over the next couple of days


## 44:10 In The Weeds

* @tannewt - Translators: if we’re trying to get 4.0 out the door in 2 weeks, we’re going to minimise the string churn in the next 2 weeks. We can add after stable is released.




## 46:33 Wrap up
