Does Mu work with Catalina? Yep!
"...the update to OSX Catalina breaks Mu in dark and high-contrast modes (text remains black, so can't be seen). It's still fine for "day" mode, although code colouration might not work properly. I tested things this morning and it's down to the version of Qt packaged with the 1.0.2 version being old. I hope to release a new alpha version early next week that fixes the issue. BTW, the only reason it's called "alpha" is because the new features may not be finished or finalised. Alpha versions of Mu still have to pass all the tests and things we do for a regular release. Just letting you know in case you get folks on your forums or support channels asking."

PyCon US 2020 is opening applications for Financial Aid, they are accepting them through January 31, 2020. To apply, first set up an account on the site, and then you will be able to fill out the application through your dashboard. The financial aid program aims to bring many folks to PyCon by limiting the maximum grant amount per person; this way PyCon can offer support to more people based on individual need. The financial aid program reimburses direct travel costs including transportation, hotel, and childcare, as well as offering discounted or waived registration tickets. For complete details, see our FAQ, and contact pycon-aid@python.org with further questions - PyCon blog.

@cater (lurking)


@CGrover (lurking)


35:00 @charlesburnaford
   * Newest thing is setting up demos with Blinka, so younger STEM groups can be taught CircuitPython.


36:02 @dakota.redstone (text only)
   * Just not keeping ahead of the chaos… 
   * I download one version and start updating archives and devices and before I “finish” updates! (which IS a good thing…)  I just need to work faster.


36:24 @danh
   * Added `microprocessor.cpu.voltage` to report current chip voltage, to be able to detect when supplied voltage starts to sag below regulator ability
   * Deleting non-CircuitPython ports from repo
   * Back to bonding filesystem work
   * Anticipating big BLE PR from tannewt


@Dave Briccetti (lurking)


38:00 @devoh (lurking)
   * Will be checking out the contributing page for things I can help with.


38:06 @hierophect (can’t make meeting today)
   * Worked on UART, which has gotten a little complicated
   * Took a break to do DAC real quick, which is now finished
   * Working on UART more this week, hoping to finish quickly
   * Cleanup and board support once that’s done


@jasonp (lurking)


38:35 @jepler (lurking)
   * Last 3 weeks: travel in Japan
   * This week: getting over jet lag, looking for some easy issues.




38:40 @jerryn
   * Testing building and using nina-fw 1.4.0 on several boards -- no issues
   * Found that CP now builds on a Raspberry Pi under Raspian Buster! Nice!
   * Following lead by @sommersoft, experimented with putting Ubuntu on a Raspberry Pi and building CP
   * Working with a minor tweak 
   * My not be overly useful since it now builds under Raspian Buster
   * But there is a “cool factor” to running Ubuntu on the RPi ;-)
   * Upgraded MacBook Air to Catalina to test impact.
   * With some effort , CP build tools are working
   * Also tested blinka and ft232h -- no problems
   * This week - traveling for work (brief recall from retirement)
   * Looking into gmtime implementation request/issue #1663 for CP


41:25 @kattni
   * Last week:
   * Guide updates: Trellis, TMP006, ADXL345(3), MAX31856, Circuit Playground Bluefruit
   * Blog posts for guide updates
   * Deprecated multiple guides
   * Finished OLED watch guide
   * Updated PyPI project spreadsheet
   * Worked with Justin and @sommersoft to get circuitpython.org/libraries/contributing updating daily
   * Helped with getting the MCP9600 library PR going
   * Set up Raspberry Pi for testing
   * Tested Pixie on RPi, started updating Pixie guide.
   * This week:
   * Test on Raspberry Pi: ADXL345, MAX31856, all boards moving forward as guides are updated
   * Finish updating Pixie guide
   * Blog currently complete guide updates
   * Add MCP9600 driver to the bundle
   * Go through old MCP9600 code, alerts, interrupts etc. Add alerts and interrupts.
   * Continue updating guides with CircuitPython Blinka Linux usage - Raspberry Python!


45:45 @krayola
   * Last week:
   * My week vanished without me working on most of the things I wanted to work on (and the holiday weekend here in Canada ate my spare time).
   * Continued to work on trying to finish subclassing of _pixelbuf, but ran into a possible blocker: calling a python subclass method from a native .subscr appears not to work, though calling subclasses in the same way from "regular" native properties works.
   * This week:
   * All the things I mentioned in my status update last week (_pixelbuf iterable, native fill, finish making the subclasses work, and slice step support, as well as more compatibility testing).


47:00 @MakerMelissa
   * Last Week:
   * Created three examples for using RGB_Display with Pillow and CPython
   * Worked on updating guides to add pages about running displays with RGB_Display on CircuitPython
   * Fixed an issue with the RA8875 on the Raspberry Pi
   * This Week:
   * Finish up RA8875 Guide CPython Pages
   * Add new 240x135 display example to RGB_Display
   * Start working on eInk guides and changing over to using displayio
   * Update eInk Python pages to work with similar examples to the TFT pages


@Mike B (lurking)


48:15 @ntoll (dad taxi means I can’t make this meeting)
   * Not CircuitPython related directly: but a large amount of fiddly work on Mu to fix a problem with installing/using third-party PyPI modules in Python3 mode. I’ve had to transition Mu’s Python3 mode to working entirely in virtualenvs. This has a knock on effect with the iPython based console (it needs to run in such a way that the packages installed in the virtualenv are available within the REPL -- easier said than done). End result -- a new alpha very soon once all the wrinkles are ironed out.


48:59 @sommersoft
   * Last Week:
   * circuitpython.org via adabot:
   * Added the assigned labels for each issue listed. Will allow for filtering of issues on the libraries/contributing page.
   * RosiePi:
   * Finally finished the Ansible playbooks, with success.
   * Discovered that at least part of my initial structure was not going to work. Started an altered structure.
   * Installed the RosiePi GitHub App on my CircuitPython fork and ran a test PR. It works! The Raspberry Pi "processed" all of the requests (every single one, to include the GitHub Actions).
   * Started a status landing page. Its local-net only for now, but will help with checking the status of the RPi without having to ssh in.
   * Next Week:
   * RosiePi:
   * Fight through current pip & $PYTHONPATH shenanigans. `sh` is giving me fits with how I have to fold in the different parts.
   * Start working on properly handling GitHub App requests (its a basic shell at this point).
   * Investigate incorporating ccache for building firmware. Builds take about 9 minutes on my RPi3B+ setup.
   * Whatever comes up, is suggested, or I stumble upon.


28:26 @tannewt
   * Last week:
   * Added active scanning/scan response support.
   * Add __bytes__ support.
   * Added prefix filtering to advertisements to reduce the Python memory churn.
   * Two broadcasting demos.
   * This week:
   * Advertising services and then 


32:19 @thea
   * Last week:
   * Looking at some old issues in CircuitPython and seeing if they’re still relevant.
   * Released a library that’s a basic driver for the Analog Devices AD5689 16-bit dac, KiCAD files for the breakout board are coming soon. :)
   * This week:
   * Working on PR to add board support for my Eurorack module.




## 52:45 In the Weeds
52:50 @kattni - I have a friend (@chickenfinga#1193 on Discord) who is looking for advice on Bluetooth beacons, w.r.t needing to find a cheap beacon he can flash, but is struggling to find any information about flashing any of them. Multi-part question: Has anyone successfully flashed a bluetooth beacon, if so, which one, and either way, does anyone understand flashing random chips well enough to help him through flashing a beacon without documentation on the beacon to help? He put together a gallery and description of what he’s trying to do [here](https://imgur.com/a/8UCifAB). He’s happy to buy whatever is necessary, but if there’s a particular chip that someone would be able to help with, he’s absolutely happy to go with that specific chip.


1:04:05 @krayola - I'd like to discuss how to call a non-native from a native subscr - if it's even possible .  I'd also like to know if anyone knows of an example of making a native iterable (I haven't even tried looking, I've been stuck on the subscr issue).
