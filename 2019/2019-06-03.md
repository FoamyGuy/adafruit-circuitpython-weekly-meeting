# CircuitPython Weekly June 3rd, 2019
Welcome to the meeting notes! Feel free to add your notes for Hug Reports and Status Updates early. We do it as a round robin sorted by username. If you can’t make the meeting, then add them anyway with a “(missing meeting)” after your username and we’ll read them off for you. 


Add any discussion topics or general questions you have to the “In the weeds” section. Thanks! We hope to see you in the meeting.


Video of the meeting is available [on YouTube](https://youtu.be/vQV0i1SQ0EU) and [on diode.zone](https://diode.zone/videos/watch/122b1b97-ec3c-452d-95cb-d0c72e699c2d)


Join here for the chat all week: http://adafru.it/discord



The weekly happens normally at 2pm ET/11am PT on Mondays. Check the #circuitpython channel for notices of change in time and links to past episodes.


CircuitPython development is sponsored by Adafruit. Please support them by purchasing hardware from adafruit.com.


Reminders: Podcast available on most services. Let us know if we’re missing some.

20:35 @charlesburnaford
* Group hug this week, been busy with dealing with going down south for weather. May be a week or two before I can get back to what I was doing.


21:10 @dakotah.redstone
* Group hug for Adafruit and the CircuitPython community, been out of the community. Work with Minecraft in the edu community. Hug for being who you are, and how you are, been pointing fingers at you for who to be and how to be, you do it right, when I need an example of how to set up a community right, I point to you.


21:56 @danh
* @Arudinne in GitHub for asking about truncated BLE peripheral names, which got me to implement advertising scan responses.
* @ladyada for churning out one Airlift thing out after another
* @jpecor (@jasonp) for doc fixes
* @tannewt for displayio speedups


23:00 @jerryn
* Group Hug


23:08 @kattni
* @sommersoft for continued work on Adabot and circuitpython.org/libraries and /contributing 
* @MrCertainly for a well handled moderation issue on Discord

24:25 @MakerMelissa
* @pt and @ladyada for welcoming me to joining Adafruit full time
* @MikeBarela for helping me with some finishing touches on my guide and helping me get my first blog post up
* @tannewt for helping with that CircuitPython_Motor Pull Request
* @tannewt for speeding up fonts. That helped enormously with the PyBadge guide I finished.


25:16 @roy
* Big group hug to everyone in the CircuitPython community for being awesome, and getting 4.0 stable out the door.
* Belated Hugs to @danh, @tannewt, and @kattni for helping me come up with a plan to get the pixelbuf compatible NeoPixel and DotStar libraries out to the world (along with the pure python PyPixelbuf library for older boards).


25:52 @sommersoft
* @barbudor for the PR to BME280.
* Group Hug!


17:44 @tannewt
* @barbudor for helping folks on Discord
* @orangedrink for the game examples for CircuitPython
* @joseph for the atom plugin including a plotter!
* @sommersoft for all of the tooling love and care.




## 26:34 Status Updates


29:06 @brentru
* Been building a high level library for using RGB LEDs with CircuitPython
   * Works with: Microcontroller, blinka, PCA9685 expander, and all RGB LEDs (strips, displays, individual LEDs and more!)
* Continued work on CircuitPython module for ATECC cryptographic co-processor


30:33 @cater
* Various misc that I did a poor job keeping track of.
* Get ADS thing wrapped up.


31:03 @charlesurnaford
* Now comes the fun, being distracted from CircuitPython because we’re working on checking out the instruments down south. Going to be fun this summer.
* May disappear for a while because we think we’re going to have a nice fairly busy hurricane season. 


32:28 @dakotah.redstone
* Distraction theme: difficult to keep track of what I’ve worked on. Video that had the trash fish in it, have to make one, call it Airfish instead. Came across so many projects that I’ve started and left buried under the detritus that is my life. Goal for next week, do one CircuitPython project so I have something to report on next week. Been away for a while, Minecraft consumes all available resources. Carving out spot for CP.

33:57 @danh: BLE work
   * Advertising packets now assembled in Python instead of in C.
   * Implemented scan responses: scanner can now get full peripheral name.
   * Refactoring in progress: removing Broadcaster.
   * BLE library and bleio API improvements: more user-controllable parameters.
   * Fixed a number of bugs in BLE library.
   * Continuing BLE work this week.


35:40 @docmollo (likely missing meeting)
   * No update since last week :( Accidentally broke my test environment at home over the weekend (yay Fedora upgrade!) and haven’t had a chance to reinstall


36:00 @jerryn
   * Mostly updating boards to latest master - revisiting/updating old projects
   * Converting several projects to use Air-lifts
   * Next week - continue updating and testing


36:45 @kattni
   * Last week:
   * Started MCP9600 guide
   * Initiated manual updates of circuitpython.org/libraries and /contributing
   * Started working on the final steps to automate the updates
   * Reviewed cp.org PRs
   * Realised I wrote the CircuitPython library for MCP9600 ages ago before having the hardware. Tested the lib, it failed, but it’s not an issue with the lib itself, it’s an issue with I2C in CircuitPython.
   * This week:
   * Mostly away Monday and Tuesday
   * Library Monday if needed - but likely doing the meetings today and then heading out again.
   * Test character LCD shield with CircuitPython 4.0
   * Tested. Works on M4, memory allocation failure on M0.
   * Seriously need to do the blog posts.
   * Hook up Saleae to MCP9600 running both CircuitPython and Arduino to figure out where the issue is - suspect clock stretching at the moment.
   * Work on getting MCP9600 CP lib going.
   * Finish MCP9600 guide.
   * Get through emails/PRs
   * Starting to pick up the CircuitPython forums Tuesdays and Thursdays


42:03 @MakerMelissa
   * Last Week:
   * Finished my PyBadge Unicode Guide and got it up and running
   * Wrote up my first blog post
   * Got a bunch of work done with getting the Orange Pi R1 documented
   * Arduino Display Driver updates
   * Fixed the outstanding CircuitPython Display Button issues
   * Updated Readme files for ST7735 displayio drivers
   * This Week:
   * Finish up Orange Pi R1 guide updates
   * Test Orange Pi more thoroughly with I2C, SPI, and PWM
   * Work on more Arduino Display Issues
   * Work on guide for displayio using Breakouts and Shields
   * Test I2S Mic on latest Raspbian
   * Close more Arduino and CircuitPython issues
43:33 @roy
   * Last Week (and the week before):
   * Meeting with @tannewt, @danh and @kattni to figure out how to get PixelBuf live with minimal impact to users, and talked about strategies to reduce the code size further.
   * Started preparing Adafruit_CircuitPython_NeoPixel and Adafruit_CircuitPython_DotStar for PRs.
   * This Week:
   * Work with @kattni to get Adafruit_CircuitPython_PyPixelBuf into shape and forked into the adafruit github account
   * Finish fixing up the Adafruit_CircuitPython_NeoPixel and Adafruit_CircuitPython_DotStar forks and PRs
   * Hopefully start some testing to understand what level of breakage (if any) we can expect on some of the smallest boards and the help we will have to provide people switching to it.

   * Last Week:
   * Circuitpython-build-tools:
   * Fixed an issue with bundling nested subfolders.
   * Adabot:
   * Fixed a typo in the circuitpython.org update script. 'TRAIVS' != 'TRAVIS'.
   * Blinka:
   * Added PR to change `pulseio.PWMOut`’s `close()` to `deinit()`
   * RosiePi:
   * refactored to use the board interaction script in the core repo (tools/cpboard.py), and to use test scripts located in the core (future).
   * started test controlling framework.
   * added ability to dynamically build based on PR commit.
   * This Week:
   * Adabot:
   * circuitpython.org/_data/libraries.json: maybe, just maybe, get it to auto-update. just submitted another fix this morning.
   * add new/updated libraries listing to daily adabot run.
   * Research “oddities” in stats for downloads by language
   * RosiePi

   * Pacing of 4.1 betas, which will include both BLE and displayio improvements.
   * BLE library breaking changes: CPy version check worth doing?
   * 5.0 alpha/beta?
57:37 @dakotah.redstone
   * What would be involved in getting a circuitpython editor up and running on an iPad pro?
1:00:19 @sommersoft (time permitting)
   * Best approach to refactor bundling of libraries: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/issues/162
   * Change releases on libs themselves to contain dependencies?
