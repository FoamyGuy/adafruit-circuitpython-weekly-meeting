## 21:46 Status Updates

@dakota.redstone (listening/lurking)


35:38 @danh
* Finished BLE PR reviews and discussed with @tannewt. Some revisions including simplifications which I re-reviewed. Ready to go and will be merged soon, after 5.0.0-alpha.5 gets some smoke testing.
* Release 5.0.0-alpha.5, first alpha since mid-September. Many fixes and changes, new boards support, tuning existing boards (multiple I2C for CPB, for instance). This release does not include the breaking BLE changes: those will be in the next alpha (or perhaps it will be a beta) soon. See https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/2236 and https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_BLE/pull/30.
* Next:
   * Merge BLE changes, re-test the examples, and then prepare an alpha.6. We also need to rewrite the current BLE guide examples.
   * Develop a strawman Adafruit/CPB BLE service for a few peripherals on the board, and test using it from the command line using bluez. This is a way to step away from the Bluefruit NUS UART style of communicating over BLE, towards a more natural BLE service-oriented style.


39:07 @Drew Fustini (lurking)
* Implemented PWM for pocket beagle
* Pin defs for beaglebone black


39:45 @Hierophect
* Working on wrapping PWM and UART. Pretty close to being finished.
* Open up for STM32 cleanup
* Lots of minor things that need to be tweaked or fixed or added
* Keeping an eye on people who need STM32 support
* Helping out new people
* Dragged into coworkerâ€™s project
* Plastics related projects


41:58 @jasonp
* PCBs for new SAMD+FPGA board are in house
* Prepping for CircuitPython support
* Itâ€™s quite a learning process


44:44 @jepler
* Last week: fixed one small CP Bluefruit bug (noise on the internal speaker if you touched the audio pad with a fingertip)
* This week: Friday is my last day at my old job, wrapping things up there.
* Would be nice to find time for a VL53L1X driver (incompatible with VL53L0X)


22:37 @kattni
* Last week:
   * Updated Fingerprint sensor guide, blogged
   * Finished STEMMA relay guide, blogged
   * Added Feather QuadWing PCBs to GitHub repo
   * Updated TTL Serial camera VC0706 guide
   * Misc. 
* This week:
   * Add USB-C micro lipo charger to micro lipo guide
      * Create Fritzing object, downloads images etc.
   * Test MPR121 HAT, update guide if successful
   * Create issue on AS7262 about adding UART support
   * Test PMS5003 on Pi with PySerial, update code, update guide if successful
   * Create guide for HCSR04, test on Pi, etc.


@KingerNorth (lurking)


@krayola (lurking)


25:35 @MakerMelissa
* Last Week:
   * Updated CircuitPython Scrolling Example to work in latest CP
   * Finished up Nokia Display Guide
   * Finished up Sharp Memory Display Guide
   * Updated CircUp guide to reflect new features
   * Worked on WS2801 Guide
   * Updated some boards on circuitpython.org website
* This Week:
   * Fix some WS2801 issues on Hardware SPI
   * Finish WS2801 Guide
   * Work on updating SSD1325 Guide
   * Work on updating IS31FL3731 CharliePlex LED Guide


@sdw_nj (lurking)


26:42 @siddacious
* Last week: Finished LSM303 and MPU-6050 guide updates until final hardware is available
*  LSM6DSOX bringup and hardware tests; Blinka with the FT232H and some light automation is the future
* Initial sketching of JSON register abstractions and code generation
* borked a pyportal trying to get fancy while assembling an EZ-Make oven. Hopefully I can find someone to fix it.
* Major progress with Droid reversing project; most of the schematic is captured
* Used sed to rename a bunch of stuff in the schematic from the useless default net names
* This week: more LSM6DSOX driver work and testing
* Guide wrap up for LSM and MPUs
* Likely starting some new boards
* Continued droid hacking; voltage checks followed by blinky and hopefully spinning some motors


31:00 @sommersoft
* Last Week:
   * GitHub Actions CI Migration
      * Got the Community bundle migration done.
      * Almost finished with the adabot migration.
   * Adabot
      * Disabled Travis infrastructure checks, and put in GitHub Actions migration checks.
      * Fixed a crash-inducing variable typo in adabot's Hacktoberfest label function. It successfully removed the labels yesterday, even though the number reported is zero above.
   * Successfully transitioned RosiePi to boot from an SSD.
* This Week:
   * Keep pushing on Actions migration.
      * Finish adabot
      * Start circuitpython-org
   * Continue researching more viable options for RosiePi's topology. Having the app handler, server, and test component all in one place limits throughput, does not scale at all beyond the number one, and leaves a single point of failure.
   * Whatever comes up, is suggested, or I stumble upon.


34:30 @stargirl (lurking until 11:30 pst, then offline)
* Last week:
   * Finished up beta hardware & software for my Eurorack project (Winterbloom Sol), found beta testers, and ordered PCBs and components. Beta modules go out later this month. ðŸŽ‰
   * Poked at BLE stuff.
* This week:
   * 100% of my energy will now be devoted to panicking about my Supercon talk. (so I may not be online much)


34:54 @tannewt (on a plane still)
* Polished up the _bleio changes and the corresponding library work and should be merged shortly. Please test it out and help us expand support for BLE services and advertisements.
* Out this week soaking up sun in Florida. Back Saturday. Will be around Sunday - Tuesday. (Running Monday meeting)


## 46:30 In The Weeds

46:57 @danh
* Make a decision on version-specific bundles mechanism: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/issues/181
   * Branches
   * Version info in files
   * Augmented tags: x.x.x+y.y.y, where x.x.x is the library version and y.y.y is the minimum CPy version compatible with x.x.x


1:01:44 @Drew Fustini
* Iâ€™d like to ask about the generic Linux PWMOut implementation:
   * https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Blinka/blob/master/src/adafruit_blinka/microcontroller/generic_linux/sysfs_pwmout.py
   * @s-light proposed abstract self._pin_path.format(self._pwmpin) as function - this way one could override it for boards where the /sys/class/pwm channel path is different like PocketBeagle/BeagleBone.
      * for example, generic needs:
         * pin_path = os.path.join(channel_path, self._pin_path.format(self._pwmpin))
      * but beagle needs:
         * pin_path = os.path.join(channel_path, self._pin_path.format(self._channel,self._pwmpin))
   * Does this sound like a good approach?
   * Details in this PR as to why the path is different on beagle:
      * https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Blinka/pull/168#issue-332797708


1:05:43 @cater
* is this a bug? or just the way it is?
   * `Adafruit CircuitPython 4.1.0 on 2019-08-02; Adafruit Trinket M0 with samd21e18
   * >>> import os
   * >>> os.stat("/font5x8.bin")
   * Traceback (most recent call last):
   *   File â€œ<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
   * OverflowError: small int overflow
   * >>> `
* note it's a M0
