# CircuitPython Weekly for 8 April 2019
Video is available here [on YouTube](https://youtu.be/YMT0KKOiBBQ).


Join here for the chat all week: https://adafru.it/discord


The weekly happens normally at 2pm ET/11am PT on Mondays. Check the #circuitpython channel on Discord for notices of change in time and links to past episodes.


CircuitPython development is sponsored by Adafruit. Please support them by purchasing hardware from https://adafruit.com.


Reminders: Podcast available on most services. Let us know if we’re missing some.
## 2:50 Community News
Circuitpython.org updates - 47 boards! we also added flag to remove boards from downloads display. features added, 9 for now. awesome added: https://circuitpython.org/awesome 


newsletter updates - moved images to folders (hit 1k limit). removed html that was not needed, now can render on github. draft is here:
https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython-weekly-newsletter/blob/gh-pages/_drafts/2019-04-09-draft.md


8/8 CircuitPython day 2019 - will start some planning post PyCon. If someone has something they want to do in their area, let us know.


15k folks in the Python Discord! https://pythondiscord.com/ Adafruit is a partner on the server (video: https://youtu.be/DIBXg8Qh7bA?t=31 )


And congrats to Nina, keynoting PyCon about… “The joys of using Python on embedded devices“

## 24:48 Status Updates
36:04 @brentru
* Last Week
   * Published DYMO Scale + CircuitPython Guide
      * If you are into hacking consumer, off-the-shelf-hardware, and comfortable with CircuitPython this guide is for you!
   * New CircuitPython Library: CircuitPython_LIFX, a helper library for the LIFX WiFi Light Remote HTTP API.
      * Guide soon!
   * Started work on CircuitPython_Hue, a helper library for the Philips Hue Light API
   * Updated PiOLED and Pi OLED Bonnet to use Blinka
* This week
   * I started a more robust testing example for CircuitPython_Adafruit_IO this morning. 
      * Goal is to ensure the CircuitPython Client and API are working as intended when the core library (or the API itself) is modified or changed.
   * Continuing work on CircuitPython_Hue module, writing a guide.

37:35 @CGrover
* Pyportal weather station project - issues with json keys. Think found reliable interim solution.
* PyPortal chasing down issue with time updates. Haven’t captured error or artificially trigger it, so still searching that.
* Mock-up of helpers needed to implement range slicer, using old CP version with framebuf
* Adapted NeoTrellis M4 to fit in eurorack space
* Looking at writing driver for SPI dual 16bit DAC for control voltages, 16bit audio. 
* Lots of learning! Still wrapping head around data structures!


@charlesburnaford
* Don’t have much of an update!


38:42 @danh
* PR reviews
* Refactored external interrupt handler, making samd-peripherals less coupled to CircuitPython.
* Incorporated and tested @hathach’s USB fixes.
* Worked with nickzoic on nRF rtc and nvm implementations.
* Multiple cases of shrinking builds as we add tiny bits of more code.
* Thinking about asynchronous computing.
* Plan to do some filesystem stress testing to see if there are still latent bugs.


41:26 @deshipu
* Small improvements to displayio
* Tetris for Hallowing https://github.com/deshipu/hallowing-tetris (unfinished)
* Next: Make µGame and stage library compatible with displayio
* Next: Make µGame use DMA


42:44 @DrewFustini - notes doc only
* For https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_PlatformDetect/issues/20 udev rules have been added by Robert Nelson to the BeagleBoard.org Debian customization package so debian user can now read the board ID from EEPROM without being root
* For https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Blinka/issues/100
* I2C is working OK on PocketBeagle and no regressions on BeagleBone Black.
* @s-light helped identify that SPI device index (/dev/spidevX.Y) changes between different kernels.  A solution was created by Robert Nelson to have consistent indexes (/dev/spi/X.Y).  I will work on making Blinka support the new scheme for PB and BBB.  I will also do additional SPI testing.


43:27 @jasonp
* Took final steps toward testing my PyPortal based video switcher control interface
   * Provides an HID interface to mimoLive software on an iMac
   * ...which controls an ATEM HDMI video switcher
   * ...which routes four 4K PTZ cameras and graphics feeds


44:41 @jerryn
* Mostly distracted last week by some house projects.
* Hope to get back in the CP swing this week.

30:30 @siddacious
* Last week - sick and working on libs with Kattni and Limor 
* Figured out eagle2fritzing tool to make fritzing objects - did INA216
* Assembled breakout over the weekend
* Finally put together CP32 board - found bug, required carving via, works! - flashing this week 
* Rest of the week is driver work for LPS35, starting guide


31:42 @sommersoft
* Last Week:
   * nRF PDMIn: Did some work to implement the sinc filter. The number representations look better, but the audio is still garbage. Still working my way through understanding DSP filtering. (Latent hug to Audacity for including raw data processing; working on nRF AudioOut first may have been a better idea. Hehe)
   * adabot
      * "Updated libraries" list: started, but the plan is changing so that's on hold.
      * Did a fairly big refactor, moving the common use functions to their own file. Also moved the CP library validator functions to their own file to ease maintainability. All of this also has the goal of easier expansion for the future.
      * Began learning & playing around with GitHub API v4 (GraphQL vs REST). It's...interesting. Requests require more thought and construction, but the flexibility with what you can get out of one request is pretty awesome. Should cut down on execution a lot. I may be requesting authorization to use GH's GraphQL Explorer on adafruit repos, this week. I'm just not sure "who" the request is sent to…
* This Week:
   * PDMIn: continue tweaking the sinc filter
   * adabot, adabot, adabot


33:03 @tannewt
* Spent last week bug hunting.
* Fixed missing TileGrid bounds check that allowed overwriting past memory
* PR out to fix issue with getting board.I2C with a pin busy outside the VM.
* More bug hunting this week with a focus on getting celeste.py running (slowly) on pybadge with displayio.


## 45:15 In The Weeds
* 45:49 Deshipu and danh: discuss async/scheduler/interrupts again https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1380
https://trio.discourse.group/t/python-for-microcontrollers-and-structured-concurrency/154
* @charlesburnaford - implement access to pin change events on mcp23017
