6:59 Engineered Sandwich is a small rechargeable freestanding light-emitting sculpture. A translucent 3D-printed lens press fits between two hand-finished wood buns. A circuit python controller randomly changes RGB LEDs, continuously projecting a cool gradient on all sides of the lens and through a series of slots at the top of the piece.

Overall: We’re close to a beta1. We’ve had a lot of refinement on the BLE side and things are improving a lot. Maybe this week or next week, it will be a late game beta. Will be making a push to get it stable. Libraries - we just hit 200, congrats to all the library folks. Sign that we have a really healthy ecosystem.

## 28:53 Status Updates
@anecdata (lurking)


@AnneB (lurking)


33:03 @arturo182 (missing meeting)
* Last week:
   * Worked more on verifying the MIMXRT10XX Feathers HW
   * Cleaning up the MIMXRT10XX port
   * Using TinyUSB for serial, still need to get MSC to work
* This week:
   * Port UF2 to MIMXRT10XX for the full CP experience
   * Continue cleanup and TinyUSB integration


33:56 @brentru 
* LW:
   * Finished “secret” (may go into store this or next week, #itsnotoutyet) project
   * Which means it’s time for CircuitPython again :)
   * Finished up a term-project last night, phew! 
      * About modeling new “smart” residential apartment buildings to create a demand-side load for disrupting NYC’s power grid operations. Feasible? Yep, with only one 632 unit building. Imagine a block :)
* TW:
   * Working with the MCP + Stemma Sensor(s) + Jupyter Notebooks. Lots of interesting data viz/manipulations possible, drawing from MathWorks’ previous work with the RasPi+sensors+MATLAB
      * Quick instrumentation for lab techs/classrooms


@cater (lurking)


35:12 @CGrover (lurking)
* Last week:
   * Where did the time go?
   * Sent off four more boards to OSH Park and OSH Stencils that should be here today.
   * Completed and submitted PRs for adding features to Crickit and PyBadger libraries. The changes came from the development of a PyBadger/PyGamer front panel for a Crickit-powered robot.
   * Built a full bevy of tests for the robot: graphics, text, sound, buttons, motors, servos, neopixels, etc. Was very challenging to find ways to use standard Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and minimize resource competition, particularly for external Stemma devices. Thinking about another Crickit PR to simplify I2C bus management when using a combination of on-board and Stemma-connected I2C devices.
* Next week:
   * Working on an overarching concept for using a PyBadge, PyGamer, or PyPortal as a universal project front panel. Since they have switches, displays, and touch panels along with Stemma ports they could save quite a bit of project fabrication time and effort. Eurorack projects may not benefit, but that just means I’ll have the opportunity to design a PyBadge board in that form factor! Here’s a quick diagram of a front panel concept with robot features. PyPanel Robot Concept
   * Will be piecing together and probing the post-office parcel of perfectly purple pasteable PCBs that were promised to pop-up presently. These are next-gen (final?) revisions of FeatherWings for the Hackaday.io contest.




37:07 @charlesburnaford
* I found the idea of bluefruit BLE MIDI would be nice to be able to detach the built in keyboard from my synth, so I can sit with the keys on my lap. Playing around with Sunvox on RPi. Hoping to figure out an easy way to interface my sunvox synth to Python with MIDI.
* With MIDI in, want to be able to download a large buffer of information
* Start by making generalised module, ask for help to turn into library


38:51 @danh
* BLE library: Added name and tx power to advertisement scan response. Added ability to get/set name and tx power via `BLERadio`. Working with @tannewt on adding buffer size and timeout parameters for UARTService.
* Make `_bleio.Connection.disconnect()` not complain if already disconnected: one less try/except to worry about.
* Finishing up parameterization of linker scripts that specify different regions in the microcontroller flash. This removes some technical debt (regions had to be specified in multiple places), and is a precursor for BLE bonding


@DaveP (lurking)


@deshipu (lurking)


@Drew Fustini (lurking)


@Grimarch (lurking)


43:46 @Hierophect
* Last week, did a plethora of things, two new ports wrapping up pending final testing: pybnano and the “blackpill” f411, both still in PR stage, but mostly wrapped up.
* Fixed a couple of minor timing issues on NeoPixel - revisit to make it more elegant
* Displayio working with tft screen, spi analysis issue.
* This week, working on porting the Meowbit that has display and SD card, and many features we haven’t finished up yet, so it makes for an integrated test


@hukuzatuna(lurking)


@JacobT (lurking)


@jasonp (lurking)


46:02 @jepler
* Last week:
   * I over-promised :) didn’t do anything substantial with stm32 port
   * Worked on MP3 playback PR
   * Worked on infrastructure code for audio sample sources PR (type safe protocols)
   * Worked on neopixel timing bug (that I caused)
* This week:
   * Type safe protocols & MP3 is my focus.  Depending on time I’ll might also get to...
   * nRF PWM playback rate bug
   * nRF USB crash fix
   * Working a bit over 20 hours last week & this week in anticipation of fewer hours in the 2nd half of the month

   * Waiting on boards


49:12 @jerryn
* Last week:
   * Experimented with some inexpensive nRF24L01+ boards 
      * Community library works -- fun stuff!
   * Found that homebrew for MacOS now provides the latest gcc version
      * Updated my Mac and it seem to be working well
   * Tested using interrupts for RFM69 on Raspberry pi
      * Good start -- not sure if it belongs in the library or if it should be a different lib since it only works on RPi - not CircuitPython
         * All interrupt related code is in the users code -- minor changes to library - once working will discuss further
* Next week
   * Keep working on interrupt implementations for RPi
      * Implement for RFM9X as well
      * Explore interrupts for other devices that have signals
         * e.g accel, temperature alerts 
      * Non-CP related - Look into RadioHead libraries usage of interrupts on RPi (appear to be disabled - not sure why)
   * BLE, BLE, BLE  so much to learn
   * nRF24L01  -- even more to learn
   * so many toys - so little time


52:15 @kattni
* Last week:
   * Worked on Circuit Playground Bluefruit NeoPixel project code
   * Put together animations for LED Animation library (thanks again, @krayola!)
      * You can now blink, color cycle, solid, sparkle, and comet
      * So much more to come
   * Started guide for CPB project
   * Wrote a page for the Circuit Playground Bluefruit for the CPB guide on installing basic necessary CircuitPython libraries - includes all the basic libs needed for many things - can be mirrored into other guides, but may still require a library install section if using a lib not listed on the guide page
   * Found a CircuitPython bug with Bluetooth
   * Helped JP with updating some CPB project code to use the Circuit Playground library
   * Helped Carter sort out issue with MCP9600 not installing from PyPI properly
* This week:
   * Finish CPB project guide:
      * Needs images, video, code PR’d to Learn repo, and guide text finished up
   * Get LED Animation code reviewed, merged and released.
   * Finish the STEMMA OLED fritzing objects
   * Fritz the Feather e-ink Friend
   * Update the Circuit Playground library to check board and import appropriate module
   * Update all CircuitPython Circuit Playground examples in the Circuit Playground repo to use new import format to work with both boards
   * Complete PyPI setup for NeoPixel_SPI
   * Update MCP9600 guide to show Python usage now that issues have been resolved


@kingernorth (lurking)


57:47 @krayola
* Last week:
   * Found bugs in _pixelbuf by trying to use it and pushed the fixes to the new-pixelbuf-api
   * Tried to find a way to address the suggestion from @tannewt but ran around in circles for a bit.  Abandoned that for now to focus on making animations.
   * Spent a bunch of time tweaking things in the Adafruit LED Animations
   * Wrote an ANSI neopixel strip emulator to test animations with (Need to finish the API and push it to Github)
* This week:
   * Work more on animations library features - the christmas tree really needs them.
   * Work on pypixelbuf
   * Fix the build failure on new-pixelbuf-api due to out of flash - likely by merging from master to get @jepler's fixes!


1:00:12 @MakerMelissa
* Last Week:
   * Merged a bunch of Blinka-related PRs
   * Added 11 new boards to the Blinka section of circuitpython.org
   * Fixed auto-versioning in the Adafruit_Python_PureIO repo.
   * Added Rotation to the TFT Gizmo library, cleaned up the code a bit, and fixed an autodoc issue that was causing Travis to fail
   * Added image function to the IS31FL3731 library
   * Created 3 Pillow examples for the IS31FL3731 library
   * Worked on new guide page describing those examples for the IS31FL3731 library

* Thanksgiving Week:
   * Fought through a nasty head cold, and got maybe 5 lines of code written.
* Last Week:
   * Was stuck at home troubleshooting some car issues.
   * Took the extra week off from coding; burn-out had creeped in farther than I realized.
* This Week:
   * Re-assess project priorities. Having seen that Dylan is moving the Travis-to-Actions transition along, I'll likely get back to that for adabot & circuitpython-org/contributing.


1:06:40 @tammymakesthings (missing meeting)
* Starting to figure out what it would take to implement a CircuitPython library for the Maxim MAX3010x pulse oximeter sensor
