"buildin my own blinka board, or i bricked my circuitpython board" wrote up a guide on flashing bootloaders for samd51, 21, using atmel studio (https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-program-samd-bootloaders)
* this week
- starting up second semester of grad school midweek 
- another! circuitpython lora/lorawan guide - multiple feather nodes transmitting to the new radio bonnet which is running

   * Very slow right now.
   * Thank you to everyone for CP2019 posts. Will be posting aggregate post today.
   * Next up - focus on bug fixing for 4.0.
   * Do people want a live stream of a detailed, low level bug?
   * Yes.


28:22 @tg-techie
