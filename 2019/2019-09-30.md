## 25:30 Status Updates
@anecdata (lurking)


29:40 @brentru
* Wrote a learn guide for updating the firmware on ESP32’s (nina-fw) shipped with our boards
   * As nina-fw progresses, we now have a formal guide for advanced users to update their firmware.
   * https://learn.adafruit.com/upgrading-esp32-firmware
* Adafruit IoT Monthly comes out this friday, sign up to receive it straight to your inbox (it’s only sent once a month): https://www.adafruitdaily.com/
* Nina-fw user-provided certificate work, doing a bit of reverse engineering.


31:33 @cgrover
* Testing string car, designing next version of board concurrent with testing, end objective is to keep PCB Feather-sized, also challenge not to continue to add functionality, added STEMMA QT and display. 
* This week nail down board def for it, and add def for flash memory chip
* Great learning experience to the comprehensive approach that is under the covers in CircuitPython
* Exciting to learn about it, convoluted when just starting out
* Music side of things - 11 of 12 tracks are licensed and uploaded to manufacturer, 12 still in progress. Final tweaks take longer than anticipated - should have known better


33:57 @danh
* Updated Windows drivers for many new boards. Not released yet.
* Refactoring the filesystem and file I/O code in CircuitPython.
* Attended and spoke at 50th SIPB (Student Information Processing Board) reunion at MIT. SIPB is a service organization that gives out computer services, writes software to help use those services, and helps students out with computer problems. http://sipb50.mit.edu/. Videos at https://www.youtube.com/user/radicalratstudios/search?query=sipb+50
* To do: Continue on filesystem refactoring.


36:20 @Dave Briccetti (I’ll speak here)
* Looking at ways to improve playing CPX tones from an application
   * for f in range(100, 5_000, 100):
   *       cpx.play_tone(f, 0.05)
   *   Evening the volume across frequencies
   * Reducing delays
   * I haven’t measured but I think the space between the sounds you see above is caused by generating the waveform prior to playing each note
   * To solve both?
   * Pre-generate sine wave data for all the notes, balancing the loudness


38:37 @deshipu
   * No progress


@DonK (lurking)


39:10 @hierophect:
   * Did I report F405 last week? The F405 is in. Also SPI, today, probably. Then SPI flash! Then Q SPI flash. That’s 4x the SPI, BONDed together, using 007 pins, with a Q, to give you more Memory. I’ll see myself out. 


@jasonp (lurking)


40:50 @jerryn
   * Upgraded IOS devices to IOS 13 and tested ability to transfer files between iPad and CIRCUITPY drive. Works well.  Now it would be nice to be able to access REPL from IOS…
   * Fixed minor  CP5.x incompatibility in PyPortal library.
   * Having fun testing new things.
   * Looking forward to Glider and continued BLE evolution.


43:45 @kattni
   * Last week:
   * Started on CPB bluetooth examples
   * Code is done for Color Picker and Plotting CPB data.
   * USB keyboard on hold because the code isn’t ready
   * Guide pages are started for both Color Picker and plotter
   * Code submitted to Adafruit CircuitPython BLE library repo to ensure it remains updated as the API gets updated.
   * Added Downloads page to MONSTER M4SK guide
   * Created fritzing object for M4SK
   * Updated the Color Picker page in the Getting Started with CP and BLE guide - it did not work with the current API, so it has been updated and is using the same code as the CPB examples - only one piece of code to update as the API changes.
   * Moved into my new house!
   * This week:
   * Library Monday!
   * Suggest on the LSM9DS1 PR to submit to LSM9DS0 if applicable 
   * Go through lib issues to label Hacktoberfest
   * @sommersoft: we can adabot something for October only, that says “if ‘good_first_issue’: add ‘hacktoberfest’. (quicker to type here with full keyboard :D)
   * Test FT532H guide in VMware Fusion
   * Finish CPB guide pages
   * Get images/videos/GIFs for guide
   * Finish copy
   * STEMMA speaker guide
   * Fritzing object
   * Usage page showing it alligator clipped to CPX/CPB, reuse GIF from product copy
   * Link to existing audio page
   * Update Trellis guide to have Linux usage
   * Deprecate three guides and point to new guides
   * Fritzing for 2.9” eInk breakout
   * Fritzing for TFT Gizmo
   * Go back through PyPI update spreadsheet
   * Update with new boards
   * Verify what needs to be updated (some have been done since I last looked at the spreadsheet)


@kingernorth (lurking)


49:43 @krayola
   * Previous weekend - submitted some PRs for typos found in some driver setup.py files
   * This week - Get back into pixelbuf work, including doing some testing on a variety of hardware, including testing pypixelbuf, and ensuring that neopixel.py and adafruit_dotstar.py work well with old code and smaller devices.


51:05 @MakerMelissa
   * Last Week:
   * Finished updating SSD1306 guides
   * Familiarized myself with the Python Image Library
   * Ported some older python example code to work with latest driver and PIL
   * Wrote CircuitPython example for TFT Gizmo
   * Wrote Arduino example for TFT Gizmo, but am having issues with the new CPB tests.
   * Biggest challenge is that the CPB is so new.
   * Started TFT gizmo Guide
   * Updated CircuitPython.org with better photos and new boards
   * This Week:
   * Finish up getting tests to pass for Arduino TFT Gizmo example
   * Finish up TFT Gizmo Guide
   * Start RGB Display for Linux guide


@MikeB (lurking)


52:42 @ntoll (missing meeting)
   * Last week was PyWeek..! I was able to cobble something together using PyperCard -- I wanted to create a game with a certain mysterious mood and atmosphere, much like how the old game Myst managed this with HyperCard. My entry is here: https://pyweek.org/e/missed/
   * Someone asked about approaches to testing. I’m writing a post about (general) Python testing for my personal blog. Should be out by end of week.
   * The lack of an “update --all” option (thanks for the suggestion Melissa) is gnawing away at me, especially since it’d be trivial to implement. So I think I’ll quickly create a PR (probably tomorrow).


53:42 @sommersoft (text only)
   * Last Week:
   * circuitpython-build-tools update:
   * Allow multiple 'package_prefix_name' entries instead of just one.
   * Iterate over files to bundle using 'pathlib' instead of 'os.walk'.
   * Community Library Bundle: 
   * Updated the travis.yml call to the bundle script using multiple prefix names, so packaged libraries are now bundled.
   * Core Docs Module Support Matrix:
   * Added processing of modules dependent of other modules.
   * Added processing of modules included as 'CIRCUITPY_DEFAULT_BUILD' & 'CIRCUITPY_MINIMAL_BUILD'
   * Improves accuracy of available modules listed for each board.
   * Continued to fight with 'libraries.json' AWS & artifact path issue.
   * Decided to un-dual-boot my laptop. Included too much in my original backup, which wrecked fresh installs...so doing multiple installs was fun.
   * This Week
   * More libraries.json/AWS wrangling. I think I'm down to the last fix, but I'll probably get a personal S3 bucket to test with before pushing any more PRs.
   * Mental todo list is empty after that, so I'll be on the hunt/open to suggestions.


55:12 @tammymakesthings (missing meeting)
   * Logging some potential enhancements to @ntoll’s circup tool, and working on those
   * Working on my DesertPy CircuitPython talk, which is being rescheduled to November or December


26:30 @tannewt
   * Writing “patches” back to CircuitPython works. Had bugs around shifting offsets to squish. May need to add “move” as well for moving within a region of a file. Can do as two patches but would shift code after unnecessarily.
   * Switched to working on BLE lib and _bleio now that workflow is roughed out. Goal this week is to get PRs out for each and establish the long term APIs so that guides and examples can be created.
   * Got PyCascades proposals in. Excited to see what they think.
   * Also want to demo Glider at Hardware Happy Hour on Thursday.
