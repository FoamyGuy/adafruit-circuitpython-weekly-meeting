10:27 Hug Reports


13:11 @brennen
* A group hug to the whole community for all your hard work and welcoming attitudes while I’ve been involved with the project.  I'm taking a new full-time gig at the Wikimedia Foundation, so I won't be around much for a while, but I wanted to say it's been a pleasure working with you all and I look forward to seeing what's in store for CircuitPython going forward.


@cater - lurking


13:52 @charlesburnaford
* Tannewt for pulling me in to get a copy of USB MIDI, working so far!


15:02 @danh

15:36 @kattni
* @brennen - Thank you for all your help with the PyPI project! I had an absolute blast working with you. I’m going to miss you! I wish you all the best at Wikimedia!
* @Maker Melissa for an epic new library! This is her first! Thank you for all the hard work and great job working through your first Travis experience!
* @tannewt for the massive CircuitPython 2019 aggregate post!
* @Roy for 3D printing me a bunch of stands for things, some miscellaneous, and an amazing name plate with Blinka on it, and a purple baby elephant! It was a box full of surprises!


16:43 @ladyada
* hugz to kattni who has been pickin' up a lot of guide and github stuff!
* hugz to dan for getting bleio uart working
* hugz to scott for displayio - its amazing


18:49 @Maker Melissa - 
* Hug report to Kattni for helping with my travis experience and getting through a few iterations of that, getting it to pass
* Siddacious for help with bitmap library


@mr certainly - lurking


17:53 @ShawnHymal -

12:43 @tg-techie
* Hug to the community - had a pretty passive week and it’s wonderful to use CP, thank you to everyone.

## 19:26 Status Updates

26:24 @brennen
* Looking into a couple of user-reported dependency issues with Blinka, wrapping up some documentation.
* As mentioned above, I won’t be doing much CircuitPython-related work for a while, but I’m hoping to keep track of things as an end-user and may pitch in here and there when I’ve got the bandwidth.


@cater - lurking


27:11 @charlesburnaford
* Working on set of functions to provide different types of MIDI messages, simple module, convert it to a CP compatible library
* Need some kind of model to use to insert code from functions to make into class


@danh
 - Finished BLE peripheral and BLE UART work for now. Two helper libraries now exist.
   Pull requests pending:
     - https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/1482  (more bleio revision)
     - https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_BLE   (simplification; UARTService as a stream)
     - https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_BluefruitConnect  (new library for use with Adafruit BLE Connect phone app)

29:33 @kattni 
* Last week-ish:
   * Finished up bulk of Prop-Maker FeatherWing guide.
   * Added CIRCUITPY Drive page to Welcome guide
   * Added “Difference between CIRCUITPY and boardnameBOOT” section to “Installing CircuitPython” page in Welcome guide
   * Deprecated series of guides along with a repo
   * Updated PCA9685 breakout page to use ServoKit
   * Updated guide for RPi and PCA9685 breakout to use ServoKit
   * Tested cookiecutter update, found issues, fixed issues.
   * Started on Radio Bonnet guide
   * Made my first fritzing object!
   * Library Monday!
* This week:
   * Finish Radio Bonnet guide.
   * Write guide with CIrcuitPython BLE demos.
   * PN532 guide update for RPi usage
   * Run another test with the cookiecutter update - hoping to wrap this up soon. It will be making cookiecutter a little more involved, but removes a lot of later work.


34:58 @Maker Melissa
* Last week, worked on RA8875 library for display, and got that up, waiting on PR approval.
* Next week want to look at some other libraries and do work on those and another thing I wanted to start looking at doing is creating a GUI that works on multiple displays that is not hardware dependent.


@mr certainly - lurking


36:24 @sommersoft
* Last Week:
   * cookiecutter:
      * Made some minor tweaks based on @Kattni's testing
   * FrequencyIn:
      * Working for the most part. Currently, calculating frequency at a rate of 1ms; reference TC is firing at about 800us relative to `current_tick()`. Finally figured out the math to account for  the ~1.6ms measurement time. But...the TC that is counting events is having "issues" with resetting the count at this rate. I'm either going to revert back to subtracting last value/not resetting count to zero, or widen the measurement time.
* This Week:
   * FrequencyIn
   * Any more cookiecutter tweaks that pop up


20:02 @tannewt
* Displayio rework checked in. Should be able to use displays on samd51 and nRF52840. Please test. Help on making libs for each display with init sequences would be welcome.
* 8 bit parallel display busses are now supported too.
* Drafted aggregate CircuitPython 2019 post.
* Getting caught up on email after going heads down on displayio.
* Will go heads down later this week to speed up rendering. After move onto built in text support and bitmap grid with goal of showing error messages on screen.


24:06 @tg-techie
* Also been doing display stuff, in CircuitPython. I’ve been working in parallel. This week, making a system where instead of just placing an object on the display, understands that there’s depth, can move an object forward by layer. Have support for pointer so you can click a button. Overhaul how things are currently done. Love to take a look at Scott’s code or use/integrate it.
* Can take a shot at porting displayio to RPi (Python)
* Met the maker of ChipQuik this week!


### 37:22 In the weeds


* 37:40 Overall CircuitPython 2019 post: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_HpiYQOVxrBMd8HSn_vvjpl629M23tu8lsxh9bMHY98/edit?usp=sharing
* 42:35 non-SPI display support - 8 bit parallel?
* 54:08 Python code to read peripherals and add objects to a “message queue”
* 57:06 Help with displayio
