## 19:27 Status Updates

24:16 @brentru
* Finished up the CircuitPython LoRa -> Adafruit IO  guide, might be live this week.
* Nothing CircuitPython planned for this week - working on some automation things.

24:36 @cater
* Autoshow as mentioned turned into a PR review
* More work on porting a dual stepper motor example from Python land to MotorKit
* Request for a gain example with ADCs, cobbled together quick example to show what gain does, and a learn guide update will come with that

@cgrover
* lurking!

25:32 @charlesburnaford
* Playing with the MIDI USB, seems to work, on the ASW version of Metro M0, going to try it on an actual version of 4.0beta. See what happens!

26:10 @danh (out)
* Did a Learn Guide for the CircusPython BLE demo.
* Improved BLE libraries and examples 

@dastels
* lurking

26:33 @jerryn
* Last Week
   * Tested Bluefruit Connect functions with feather_nrf240 and Crickit  -- great stuff!
      * Working on controlling pan/tilt with iPhone sensors (accel/gyro…)
   * Tried using displayio on the 2.4 inch TFT with feather m4 express. Finally think I understand how to write text!!  
   * Experimented with new displayio features on Hallowing and 2.4 inch TFT on feather m4. Nice to see the messages and REPL on the display.
   * Trying  PN532 NFC reader -- found/fixed some minor issues in examples.
* This week --
   * trying to get Bluefruit LE Connect App to build for MacOS
   * Keep working with BLE 
   * Keep testing/breaking things

30:23 @kattni
* Last week:
   * Routed my first board in Eagle! Started as an assignment to design the sensor part, but turned into completing the entire board.
   * Library Monday - [CircuitPython Libraries tracking issue](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1246) 
   * Started the Getting Started with CircuitPython and nRF52840 guide
   * Received a lesson on the basics of driver writing
   * Worked on updating and documenting my tabletop lightbox photo studio build.
* This week:
   * Fritzing object for ADXL343
   * Update the eInk guide to include the newest display
   * Port two MotorKit demos from the Motor Python lib to CircuitPython
   * Write the driver for the VCNL4040 (the PCBs are in!)
   * More fritzing objects later this week.
   * Low priority: update the CPX lib to remove 2.x backwards compatibility

32:33 @makermelissa
* Last Week:
   * Finished the DotStar Featherwing Library
   * Did my first code review
* Next Week:
   * Working on NeoPixel Featherwing
   * Work on 7-Segment Featherwing
   * Work on RTC Featherwing
   * Start writing RA8875 Guide

@mikebarela
* Lurking

@sdw_nj
* Lurking.

33:22 @siddacious
* Last Week; Got my guide into moderation and new CP32-M4 WROVER board mostly routed
* This Week: new board off to the fab, Getting displayio on older boards and a few misc. Eagle projects

33:45 @sommersoft
* Last Week:
   * adabot:
      * Mitigated a couple intermittent Travis cron failures with the library report. Hopefully. We'll see if they pop back up this week. (And I just realized I didn't gracefully handle one, but may provide insight to the root cause)
   * FrequencyIn:
      * Changed the polling period to 10ms, which greatly stabilized the event counts. Having thoughts about making this user configurable. Now steadily capturing up to 2MHz with no ill effects on the VM.
      * Frequency calculation is still low (2KHz reads as ~1.8xKHz, 4K as ~3.4xKHz, so on). I believe this is due to my poor mathing, and attempts at adjusting for EIC latency.
* This Week:
   * FrequencyIn
   * adabot:
      * Work on newline issue for Google Docs transcription
   * Maybe circuitpython-build-tools for `adafruit_framebuf` inclusion of default font.bin. https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_framebuf/issues/11

19:58 @tannewt
* Checked in TileGrid, a generalization of Sprite. Enables terminal when display isn’t in use by user code. Also adds backlight management to Display.
* Changed the way rotation works to align it to the screen refresh.
* Fixed a couple memory issue on the live stream. Recording going up today. Thanks to everyone who watched live. Video of the stream is [on Youtube](https://youtu.be/baa5ILZTRkQ) and [diode.zone](https://diode.zone/videos/watch/cf9edcce-04d4-4ce4-9e95-33ab503fb480)
* Speed up file reads with FATFS fast seek.
* Going over outstanding 4.0.0 bugs early this week.
* May do performance work for displayio later in the week.

23:04 @tg-techie
* Working on rewriting code from scratch to make it cleaner
* Didn’t finish the week goal, college is more important!
* Object abstraction done in 2 days, hung up on memory bug for 3 days, had input numbers into a function wrong.
* 80kb to 30kb
* Continue working on it - it’s on GitHub, will love input when done!

## 35:17 In the weeds
@sommersoft
* 35:49 Future of `adafruit_framebuf`:
   * Will it be used with `displayio`?
   * Or is it merely a support bridge until `displayio` is fully implemented, and then used only with RPi?
   * Answer: good to support framebuf for now because it’s needed for some displays, but not to use over displayio, but it won’t be going away soon


* 37:58 = @charlesburnaford
   * Wrapper for MIDI msgs? - having issues with incoming messages
   * https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_MIDI
