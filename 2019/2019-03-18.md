# CircuitPython Weekly March 18th, 2019
Video is available here [on YouTube](https://youtu.be/l60Xka431Z4) and [on diode.zone](https://diode.zone/videos/watch/3b9500d4-0376-4e6d-af9b-8b46a40edb5c)

Thanks to @kattni for taking notes!

Join here for the chat all week: http://adafru.it/discord

The weekly happens normally at 2pm ET/11am PT on Mondays. Check the #circuitpython channel for notices of change in time and links to past episodes.

CircuitPython development is sponsored by Adafruit. Please support them by purchasing hardware from adafruit.com.

Reminders: Podcast available on most services. Let us know if we’re missing some.

## 3:24 Community News

Thinking about picking a day for "CircuitPython day" ... maybe 8/8 of each year since it looks like 2 snakes? Are there better days/dates? Let us know. Other ideas: 5-2, 6-6, 6-9, 

CircuitPython in space, interesting development for Python, from one of the makers (Max) “CircuitPython provides an approachable and logical means of conducting science with hardware. Paired with low-cost hardware shown to work in space, we can enable an new generation to question and explore the unknown. With the necessary “satellite stuff” already baked in, students can spend their time trying something new rather than reinventing the wheel (similar philosophy to early Arduino efforts and the microcontroller movement in general).”

If you are speaking a user group, meetup, event, hacker/maker space or whatever and wherever else and it’s something with Python on hardware let us know, we can add the event to our blog, newsletter, Twitter, etc. and more! Python on hardware takes the stage in Singapore FOSSASIA https://2019.fossasia.org/event/schedule.html#5001

## 7:50 State of CircuitPython + Libraries

NOTE: This is a few days old because @tannewt broke auth keys. Will fix for next week.

## 29:52 Status Updates
35:00 @brentr
* NEW Guide: https://learn.adafruit.com/pyportal-email-display/
   * This project turns your PyPortal into an interactive display. Send emails to a Zapier inbound inbox and have them appear on the PyPortal's display using Circuit python code.
* Working on a PyPortal Smart Thermostat Guide/Project
* Started development on a new Adafruit IO API Documentation: Now supporting Circuit python and Python.
   * Using Markdown - like Circuit python.org. Easy to contribute to.
   * Detailed HTTP/MQTT API and code snippets!
   * GIF in in the Discord
   * Suggestions appreciated, it’s very early right now.

* Finished the “classic” MIDI UART library. @JohnPark successfully tested it on a couple of his unique DIY MIDI controllers. Coupled it with my Range_Slicer library to quantize potentiometer settings into MIDI control and note codes. Was completely distracted by PyPortal projects this week. Customized the Weather Station project and used it as an excuse to dive deeper into CircuitPython coding. Of course, now I have a lot more questions to ask. Thanks again to everyone for their patience.
* Over the next week I’ll be moving most of my development project archives into GitHub now that I’m dangerously quasi-knowledgeable. I’ll continue to wrap up the test of non-linear Range_Slicer library algorithms and will finally send the PCB off to OSH Park. If PyPortal doesn’t call to me. My weather station needs to play some wave files of our local weatherperson’s glib remarks at appropriate intervals.

37:54 @danh
* Disabled SPIM3 on nRF52840 due to bad interaction with SoftDevice.
* Debugged filesystem corruption issues; release fixes as beta.5.
* Fixed internal flash filesystem corruption on nRF52840 without external flash.
* PWMOut: fix default arg value
* Will continue with:
   *  further 4.0.0 fixes
   * have an idea for smoother PWMOut transitions on SAMD with TC’s.

39:30 @dastels - was lurking.
* I wrote a logging library for CP based on CPython's (much simpler). Like CPython's it uses pluggable message handlers for publishing. Guide should be live soon with sample handlers for uart, file, and Adafruit IO (on the PyPortal).
* ST:TNG inspired alarm clock in CP is nearing completion as well. Just waiting on final case design from Noe & Pedro.

40:11 @deshipu
* PewPew now has a mailing list at pewpew@python.org
* Updated the µGame board definition to include the frozen modules, so that the firmware at circuitpython.org is usable (PR pending).
* Designed a FeatherWing for a capacitive gesture sensor MGC3030 — we will see how well it works when the PCBs arrive.

42:04 @jerryn
* Beta4/5 testing….
* Updated several libraries to accommodate displayio API change to TileGrid
   * Simple fix, but it impacted several PyPortal demos - hope we got them all
* Updated esp32spi_aio_post example to fix an issue with text strings. 
   * Came up a few times on discord since this is used in some guides.

43:27 @kattni
* Last week:
   * Finished BMP388 guide.
   * Designed a single potentiometer breakout from start to finish - had it shipped out for a proto run.
   * Fixed up a couple of issues on product guides
   * Started the CP library for TPA2016
   * [6 hour soldering marathon this weekend for PyCon](https://youtu.be/SqYOC_pNouY)
* This week:
   * Fix MotorKit/ServoKit I2C bug
   * Finish library for TPA2016
   * Start AD8495 guide
   * Start designing dual potentiometer breakout.

18:42 @MakerMelissa
* Last Week:
   * Debugged the some issues with SPI on a PR for BME280
   * Tested SPI on a PR for BME680
   * Did a bunch of work on my PyPortal Calculator
   * Wrote a simpletest for the Adafruit_CircuitPython_ILI9341 using displayio
   * Started subclassing Adafruit_CircuitPython_ST7735 so it would work with more variations of the display
   * Finished up my RA8875 Guide. I want to go over it again before submitting it and I also noticed that preview isn’t working and don’t know if that’s an issue with my guide or learn.
   * Tested several other issues.
* This Week:
   * Get my guide submitted and any corrections made
   * Work on getting some display drivers written
   * Work on getting my PyPortal Calculator in a more complete state
   * Get some more FeatherWing Drivers written with the Adalogger being the last non-displayio dependent FeatherWing.

44:48 @sommersoft
* Last Week:
   * Put MixerVoice on hold for when we’re closer to 5.x
   * Started working on nRF PDMIn for 4.x. It’s compiling, and can at least activate recording. Working on the buffer management wrt EasyDMA. The driver is cryptic (to me) in how the cycle works and when it expects a new pointer. Think I noticed an error in my order of operations this morning...
* This Week:
   * Keep pushing on PDMIn

30:33 @tannewt
* Did Beta.4 livestream on Friday followed by GameBoy stuff. Accidentally showed some credentials and revoked them.
* Will upload livestream Monday.
* Will check build_board_info is able to run.
* Bug hunting for 4.0.0. Likely USB since Dan is kicking FS butt.
* Out Friday and Monday for a quick trip to Michigan for a birthday.

33:37 @Tg-techie
* This week - dug into documentation. Not done. Up online and live what is done. On the website. Jekyll and Python from a python script. https://docs.tg-techie.com/gui

## 46:21 In the weeds
* 46:55@jerryn - adafruit_io not in bundle - should it have been built over the weekend since it was added Friday? Does adabot get the weekend off? Or was it just mad at Scott?
* 48:44 @charlesburnaford - I would like to join in the weeds . I am trying to use the busio-uart. For uart  midi on the pi and it does not work for the midi baud rate.
