## 27:00 Status Updates


39:40 @Anne B
* Simple e-ink guide for text and graphics for CP
* Check out: circuitpython on reddit, awesome-circuitpython, python on microcontrollers newsletter


41:49 @brentru (missing meeting)
* Woah, it’s already november! The IoT Monthly for November comes out this friday, sign up over at https://www.adafruitdaily.com 
* Exam/proposal season for me, won’t be online often this week or next. Tagging me on github will help me prioritize an issue (if you see one).
   * Doing a “fun” proposal for a course about silent-attacks on energy distribution systems via compromised IoT hubs in residential buildings (raising your thermostat a little bit). And then we’re going to be mathematically modeling the effects.
* Working on non-cp project(s) for adafruit rn, looking at mid-nov. As a finish-up-date


@cater (lurking)


42:33 @cgrover
* Learning to use a laser cutter to fabricate Eurorack and project enclosure front panels from KiCAD PCB drawings. Looking forward to experimenting with a variety of clear, translucent, and bendable materials.
* Latest revision of the StringCar M0 Express board will arrive soon. Until then, working on wrapping up the dual 12-bit and dual 16-bit 10-volt Stemma DAC Euro panels and testing the StringCar M4 main+expansion board design. The removable expansion board will house an SD card, Stemma-QT jack, and SWD connector -- features that won’t be used when racing but occasionally when characterizing motor/battery combinations and when experimenting with sensors.
  45:40 @charlesburnaford
* No status updates


45:47 @danh
* Testing and reviewing @tannewt’s new BLE PR’s. Scott had to leave on vacation before finishing the BLE examples. I’ve gotten BLE UART server to work, and I’m working on BLE UART client. I have some ideas about library API, structure, and naming I’ll discuss with Scott when he returns.
* Added Arduino Nano 33 BLE board definition; testing by @ladyada.
* Added ItsyBitsy nRF52840 board definition. Turns out we had bugs in the bitbangio.SPI implementation, which manifested only on nrf and caused the on-board status DotStar not to work. Again thanks to @ladyada for testing; I had to simulate the board with a Feather and an external DotStar


@DaveP (lurking)


@deshipu (lurking)


48:19 @Hierophect

34:12 @siddacious
* last week: lsm303agr tester and test code
* archived the old arduino lib
* updated the lsm303 guide to use the new libs
* worked with @somersoft on moving the cp repos from travis to github actions. I mainly just watched as he made things work.
* assembled and tested new lps33 board, pushed a rev b with a minor change to the headers. Coming soon!
* assembled the lsm6dsox with basic smoke check (no smoke found)
* made great progress in reverse engineering my droid, started sketching out the schematic
* This week: More GH actions testing and initial migration steps
*    LSM303 and Mpu6050 guide work
*    LSM6DSOX testing/driver work
*    supercon prep
*    more droid hacking. Hoping to finish a first schematic sketch, get some motors turning, and practice bypassing the code protection without wiping the flash :|


37:08 @sommersoft (missing meeting. day_job conflict.)
* Last Week:
   * Library GitHub Actions CI Migration
      * Worked with @siddacious on getting a good template for the Actions workflows. They've been highly automated to reduce manual steps during migration, which will also aid maintenance (git patchable!). I think we're 99.999% finished. If you like YAML, and CI...and/or helping: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_TestRepo/tree/master/.github/workflows
      * Started reviewing/planning the few non-standard workflows (basically, the Adafruit and Community bundles).
      * Started reviewing/planning transitions for the two Travis cron jobs: adabot (bundle updates/releases & daily reports) and circuitpython-org (libraries & contributing page data).
   * Found a pending PR on 'rpi-ws281x-python' that allows it to be installed on a non-Raspbian RPi. That RosiePi hurdle can now be cleared...
   * Non-CircuitPython: finally got a new case for the desktop. The 17-year old case, that had the decibel range of an F-18, has been handed down to the non-techie kiddo with leftover components. New case...is sooo quiet. It’s weird.
* This Week:
   * Keep pushing on Actions migration.
   * Whatever comes up, is suggested, or I stumble upon.


38:33 @stargirl
* Last week
   * Sent PRs to fixup some rtc docs and fix an issue with PWM’s duty cycle.
   * I released another (yes, another) library: Winterbloom SmolMIDI which is a super slimmed down MIDI library. Immediately ran into MIDI buffer issues. :D
* This week
   * Heads down on writing software and figuring out manufacturing details for my Eurorack module, feel free to keep up with me on Twitter (@theavalkyrie).
   * Getting ready for my supercon talk 💀
