## 25:39 Status Updates
@anecdata (lurking)


37:52 @brentru, notes only
* LW:
   * Starting to wrap a larger adafruit project, guide will be published this week for it.
   * Published the IoT Monthly for December 2019, went out yesterday
* TW: 
   * IO Support
   * Wrapping project
   * Finishing out the semester, working on an ongoing term project.


@cater (lurking)


38:20 @CGrover (text-only)
* Last week:
   * Wrapped up the six FeatherWing projects for the Hackaday.io Take Flight with Feather contest. Funny how ideas for new FeatherWings just pop out of nowhere.
   * Wracked the brain cells to write some Crickit FeatherWing testing code (in CircuitPython) for the RobotFriend + PyBadge + Crickit project. Was hoping to take advantage of the existing libraries, but I2C bus competition/management became an issue when using the stock Crickit, Seesaw, and PyBadger libraries. Was successful using some of the subclasses, so that’ll become the path forward. I may create some helpers or a new class to add some frosting.
   * Threw together a drafty graphic of the Crickit FeatherWing pinout. Was helpful when walking through the existing library code. Crickit pinout diagram
   * Exercised the new rechargeable 80-volt Lithium brushless-motor snow thrower yesterday. Worked great! Couldn’t find the SWD port, though.
* Next week:
   * Finish the Robot Friend test routines, helpers, and libraries.
   * Build the long-awaited clothes dryer duct temperature gradient monitor.
   * Back into the studio to record a collection of Foley sound effects tracks for a locally-produced UFO SciFi film. Hoping to throw in some Theremin sounds along with a vibraslap and two thundertubes.


@dakotah.redstone (lurking)


39:41 @danh
* Fixed `UART.write()` being non-blocking by accident on atmel-samd, making it too easy to overflow on write. Adding get/set `UART.timeout` property.
* Lotsa PR reviews.
* Upcoming: precursor PR’s for BLE bonding.


@DaveP (lurking)


@dherrada (lurking)


41:03 @Hierophect:
* Did nothing much this past week.
* Before that, adding more boards to CircuitPython such as the PyBoard Nano.
* Soon adding Meowbit.
* Figuring out recent stuff like neopixel support.
* Managed to rig up uncanny eyes to OpenCV to track humans.


@JacobT (lurking)


@jasonp (lurking)


43:00 @jepler
* Last week & this morning:
   * Brought mp3 playback with Adafruit_MP3 to draft PR status
   * Continued to work on gcc9 PR
   * Provided requested performance measures for background tasks PR
   * Worked on bugfix for nRF USB crash, but it was not accepted
   * Filed a PR to gain back over 1kB code space on the most constrained builds
* This week:
   * Continue to work on gcc9 PR based on feedback
   * Continue to work on mp3 PR based on known problems
   * Work on nRF PWM audio bug (stereo waveform, mono output)
      * Otherwise, mp3 playback won’t work on CPB
   * Work on nRF USB crash, find a better fix that can be accepted
   * Get up to speed on stm32 port
   * Hopefully start working on audio for stm32
* Ongoing fun projects:
   * Actually order edge lit display PCBs and parts
   * Organizing my home office


45:20 @jerryn
* Last week
   * Tested several BLE demos and adapted several to the new API
      * Submitted PRs for luminaries and snowglobe
      * Looking forward to the new IOS App
   * Found an issue with nRF52840 (non-express) boards and CP5.0
      * Can cause some serious corruption -- requiring J-Link to recover
         * Be careful out there...
   * I know I did more but can’t remember what. Someday, I’ll learn to make notes…
* Next week
   * More BLE fun
   * Return to some RFM9x projects
   * Aside-- just discovered remote GPIO control on RPi -- wow! Don’t know how I missed that!


26:49 @kattni
* Last week:
   * Updated ADI Motion and Temperature FeatherWing guide with new Fritzing object and fab print
   * Fixed a typo in a code snippet in the CircuitPython Essentials guide Servo page
   * Updated the first guide I wrote: Circuit Playground Express Piano in the Key of Lime - wasn’t as out of date as I expected.
      * Tested on CPB with new Circuit Playground bluefruit module.
   * Verified BLE related guides all match new API
   * Prepped STEMMA OLED fritzings for Limor to do some magic
   * Started work on a CPB project - eventual plan is to have one controlling another, with the central CPB changing colors on and switching between animations on the peripheral CPB using accelerometer and buttons. Here’s what I have done so far:
      * Added animations to Adafruit CircuitPython LED Animations library
         * Color cycle, blink, comet, sparkle
      * Accelerometer on central changing colors of animations while animations are running live
      * Slide switch turns off LEDs and animations
      * Buttons on central sending button packets to peripheral
      * Found an issue worth filing about sending packets too quickly 
      * Central code consistently crashing to Hardfault_Handler.
* This week:
   * File issue on BLE library to determine whether it’s worth changing how the ring buffer overflow is handled
   * File issue on CircuitPython regarding Hardfault_Handler crash
   * Finish CPB project:
      * Get buttons switching between animations, and freezing color.
      * Figure out how to take a chunk of error handling code in the central code and make it only occur once in the central code vs. being in every section
      * PR for animations library.
      * Write guide.


30:33 @krayola
* Last week:
   * Got the _pixelbuf changes working including iterable support and native fill()
   * These changes included changing the signature of subscr() to make it possible for instances of native subclasses to work with the original object instance during subscript calls. Still looking for feedback on the PR regarding possible ways to avoid this signature change to subscr.
   * Fought battles with gitlab actions for a while.
   * Got Adafruit_CircuitPython_Dotstar working with the new _pixelbuf API using subclassing!  Involved fighting with Travis and remembering pylint==1.9.2 and python 3.6.
   * Updated Adafruit_CircuitPython_Dotstar pylintrc to match cookie cutter.
   * Got Adafruit_CircuitPython_NeoPixel working with the new _pixelbuf API.    Also involved fighting with Travis.
   * Tried to find a way not to change the subscr signature for many hours.
   * Worked with @kattni on Adafruit_LED_Animation to do non-blocking pretty things on strips of LEDs ... easily.
* This week:
   * Fix the merge conflicts for _pixelbuf changes.
   * Fix the bug I forgot with slices with steps > 1 returning IndexError: range out of bounds
   * Test Adafruit_CircuitPython_NeoPixel's NeoPixel_SPI class _pixelbuf compatibility changes on the hardware it is for (I think Pi?)
   * Make pypixelbuf match the _pixelbuf API and test DotStar and Neopixel - and find a board without _pixelbuf and see if pypixelbuf + neopixel will even fit.


32:57 @MakerMelissa
* Last Week:
   * Finished updating libraries using displayio to work in both CircuitPython 4 and 5
   * Fixed an issue with the RA8875 driver and some incorrect size calculations
   * Caught up on a lot of other miscellaneous PRs and issues
   * Submitted PR for Blinka to work on a secondary i2c port using the same pins
* This week:
   * Work on IS31FL3731 Pillow Example and update guide
   * Update PyBadger to work better with external fonts


@sdw_nj (lurking)


34:34 @stargirl (offline)
* Last week
   * Made the `micropython.native` decorator no-op if support isn’t compiled which makes writing drivers that can take advantage of the speedups a little easier.
   * Assembled four beta Winterbloom Sol modules. :)
* This week
   * Working on sample code and guides for my beta testers.




34:56 @tannewt
* Last week was very short largely worked on ANCS demo.
* This full week, checking in ANCS code. Working on bonding with Dan. Shouldn’t need any more API work.
* Probably looking into Apple Media Service as well.
* Hopefully get back to HID debugging as well.
* Kick-off 2020 planning shortly. Will need to look back at last year’s.


## 48:05 In the Weeds
48:37 @jerryn -- add some details to issue with nRF52840 (non-express) boards  and CP5.0 if anyone interested


53:36 @jerryn question about gcc 9 -- are “packages” available yet -- do you have to build from sources? Would be nice to have it for RPi ...


55:50 @jepler and @hierophect
AudioIO on STM32 discussion


1:02:55 @krayola (time permitting) Appear to be out of space on CPX for circuitplayground_express_displayio for zh_Latn_pinyin


## 1:06:40 Wrap-up
