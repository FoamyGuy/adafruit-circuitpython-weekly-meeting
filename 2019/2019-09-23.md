# CircuitPython Weekly for 23 September 2019
Welcome to the CircuitPython Weekly meeting notes! Feel free to add your notes for Hug Reports and Status Updates early. During the meeting, we go through them as a round robin sorted by username. If you can’t make the meeting and would still like to participate, add your notes with a “(missing meeting)” after your username and we’ll read them off for you. 


Add any longer-form discussion topics or general questions you have to the “In the weeds” section. 


Thanks! We hope to see you in the meeting!


Video is available here [on YouTube]().


Join here for the chat all week: http://adafru.it/discord


The weekly happens normally at 2pm ET/11am PT on Mondays. Check the #circuitpython channel on Discord for notices of change in time and links to past meetings.


CircuitPython development is sponsored by Adafruit. Please support them by purchasing hardware from https://adafruit.com.


Reminders: Podcast available on most services. Let us know if we’re missing some.

CircuitPython snakes its way to FT232H, we now we have CircuitPython Blinka support, so you can control sensors, oleds, buttons, LEDs and more all via FT232H! All thanks to Carter who fearlessly took on this code support – we’ll start writing up a guide in the next week or two

* I’ve been working on non-circuitpython project(s) since then.


43:18 @cater

45:56 @deshipu
* version 6 of PewPew M4, needs more work. Trying using laser cutting button caps


@DonK (lurking)


47:15 @hierophect
* new peripheral remap system completed 
* I2C is now fully operational with pin selection
* OS and Struct added
* Working on adding more board support
* probably reorganizing some stuff about how boards are added


@jasonp (lurking)
* No update


49:04 @jerryn
* Spent most of last week in the woods -- lovely!
* Nothing special to report 


23:33 @kattni
* Last week:
   * Hallowing M4 guide, everything that goes with that
      * Most complicated Fritzing I’ve ever done
   * Started on fixing up libraries created pre-cookiecutter to work with circup
   * Worked through some circuitpython.org updates with @sommersoft and Justin
   * Inventoried my breakouts to create a second set and found some minor bugs in a few libraries that I introduced by using the same setup.py for multiple libs and apparently not updating the GitHub URL for the lib from the setup.py I used - issues fixed
   * Various other things I’m forgetting
* This week:
   * Library Monday!
   * MONSTER M4SK downloads page and Fritzing
   * Finish fixing up libs
   * Start on Circuit Playground Bluefruit Bluetooth examples
      * Color picker, bluetooth keyboard, plot temp/light levels to Bluefruit app
      * Create guide page for each
   * Guide for STEMMA speaker
   * Help Melissa with the TFT Gizmo guide
   * Continue to sort out circuitpython.org
   * Moving Friday!


@KingerNorth (lurking)


26:24 @MakerMelissa
* Last Week:
   * Finished the CircUp guide
   * Updated some boards on CircuitPython.org
   * Updated the Color TFT DisplayIO examples and all associated learn guides
   * Worked on updating the SSD1306 DisplayIO example and some Learn Guide pages.
   * Fixed a couple of OLED CircuitPython HalloWing M4 Learn Guide Examples originally written for HalloWing M0
   * Added some missing pin aliases to CircuitPython board definition for HalloWing M4
* Next Week:
   * Continue working on SSD1306 OLED learn guide pages
   * Work with Kattni on TFT Gizmo Guide
   * If time permits, add some more boards to Blinka


@MikeB (lurking)


27:30 @ntoll
* Today: added support for handling byte compiled modules in circup.
* Today: fixed #10 (ignore hidden files)
* Today: report CircuitPython version and suggest update if out of date.
* PR with all this is here: https://github.com/ntoll/circup/pull/12
* Feedback welcome! :-)
* All other times: CodeGrades / Mu work, PyperCard, writing blog posts. Rest of week is PyWeek.






30:00 @siddacious
* Tested caters FT232h blinka PR.
* Nearly done with the Arduino MPU-6050 driver
* Got the APDS-9500 sensing gestures by porting an Arduino driver in a somewhat automated fashion
* Next: Writing the MPU6050 CP driver
* Playing around more /filling out the APDS-9500 CP driver
* Halloween costume prototyping
* Starting some new boards


33:50 @sommersoft (not in meeting)
* Last Week:
   * Adabot:
      * Finished "days open" metrics and standard label library infrastructure check.
   * circuitpython.org
      * Worked the first iteration of moving 'libraries.json' to AWS. Currently failing, due to target path woes.
   * circuitpython-build-tools:
      * I got the Community Bundle building 98% correct, by using ' package_prefix_name="" '. The 2% incorrect is an included 'docs/conf.py'.
      * Ran through some models/exercises of using 'pathlib' instead of 'os.walk' to gather package files. So far, using 'pathlib' looks like it would be much cleaner and less hacky (I wrote the current 'os.walk' code, and even I struggle to read it at times).

   * This Week:
   * Fix 'libraries.json' AWS target path issue.
   * circuitpython-build-tools:
   * Try next idea for Community Bundle; allow a list of 'package_prefix_name' instead of just one string.
   * Further 'pathlib' research.
   * Core Docs Module Support Matrix:
   * Work on handling the dependant-by-default modules (e.g. 'audiocore' & 'audiomixer' are enabled by the value of 'audioio').


35:02 @tammymakesthings (missing meeting)
   * Still wrapping up my move, so not much progress this week on stuff. BUT, I have my home office and all my computers and monitors set up, so that’s a win.
   * Working on a CircuitPython presentation/demo for the DesertPy user group, which will happen either this week or after October, depending on progress.
   * Looking at the code for @ntoll’s circup tool, and have a few ideas for enhancements.


35:29 @tannewt
   * Got CP supervisor re-advertising and sending file on command. Can iterate on app without needing to reset device.
   * Lots of mobile app work last week.
   * Proved out running pyright in React Native got the editor based on the parse tree rather than one large text input. Bonus is that the keyboard can be dismissed.
   * Also got it mostly going on Android. Just had issues with sizing text input.
   * This week the goal is to complete the read-edit-write cycle. (First two kinda work now.)
   * Once that is done, then the goal is to get it running on more folk’s devices. (iOS test flight internally and android side loading) Will still be very limited.
   * PyCascades CFP is closed next Monday so also writing up a few presentation ideas. Will also submit them to PyCon too.
   * Will be speaking about the GameBoy at Supercon!


40:48 @TG-Techie
   * This week started learning C, working with atmel chips. Starting to see how the CP abstractions are working
   * Working on GUI project to be more platform agnostic, working on PyPortal, will be able to work on many other platforms as well
## 49:41 In The Weeds
@hierophect
   * My 405 support package is derailing on into CCRAM right after startup, and I can’t figure out why. If anyone is familiar with the pyboard, I was wondering if this is some kind of sneaky bootloader thing. CCRAM isn’t even referenced in the linker setup or the startup files. 
   * Having issues getting to his code, @tannewt suggests that it may have something to do with the ROM bootloader that STM32’s use/have


## 59:39 Wrap-Up
