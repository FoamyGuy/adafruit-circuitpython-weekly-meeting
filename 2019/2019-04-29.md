## 21:53 Status Updates


25:39 @brentru
* Last Week:
   * Been getting a new newsletter set up - The Adafruit IOT Monthly Newsletter
      * Looking at an official release very soon, within the next two weeks or sooner!
   * Working on the new Adafruit IO Documentation Pages
      * Writing and rewriting documentation is hard, really hard. Hopefully this’ll make using Adafruit IO a breeze...especially with CircuitPython
      * Looking at a release in the next three weeks, keep your eyes peeled to our social channels
   * Working on misc. Airlift work - Metro WiFi Guide and more! 
* This Week:
   * Adafruit IOT Monthly for May 2019 - Wrote the newsletter this AM, going out on Friday!
   * Adafruit IO API: Finishing up development on this project
   * Adafruit IO Basics: AirLift, guide for using Arduino and CircuitPython devices with an AirLift Co-Processor with Adafruit IO. It’s easy - way easy!
   * Integrating Particle Cloud with Adafruit IO: Webhook’ing and formalizing documentation on how you can connect a particle device (which are compatible with Circuit python) to Adafruit IO. This’ll sorta-kinda enable a mesh networking solution for Adafruit IO.

35:13 @sdw_nj - not in meeting
* Figured out why I wasn’t getting useful data when attempting to analyze serial and USB data
* I had seen it dome in a OpenTechLab video and remembered “50” but not units so I think when I looked at Pulseview and saw 50 kHz as the only 50 I assumed that was the same as in the video.  
* In fact 50MHz (roughly 4 x 12MHz for USB full speed) was used in the video which my logic can’t do (it has a max of 24MHz).
* Since I wanted to be able to analyze the data both going over serial and USB, I ordered a 16 channel, 100MHz logic analyzer from AliExpress.
* I’m also continuing to read about the details of how USB operates.

* Previously on “what sidd did”:
   * Another board off to oshpark and another off to fab
   * driver work, parts ordered
   * Build two more CP32 modules and got CP loaded
   * Finally figured out LPS35 interrupt registers and found some bugs
   * Made more molds for Five Points Fest
* This week, tune in to see sidd:
   * Wrap up a driver and start a new one
   * Get another two boards off to fab before pycon
   * PyCon Fri-Monday!
   * With any luck bringup on a +0p s33kr3+ shrink of a existing board

* Last Week:
   * Adabot
      * finished initial cp.org libraries updater.
      * added adabot as a submodule to cp.org repo, to allow Travis to run the updater as a cron. PR is still in work.
   * nRF PDMIn:
      * got a couple moments to try tweaking the output values; didn't result in any changes.
   * Mostly unrelated: 
      * did some desktop PC upgrades. since upgrades are always smooth, i was focused on some troubleshooting for a couple days.
      * Started on Microsoft DevOps pro-cert.


* This Week:
   * Adabot:
      * Finish setting up Travis cron for cp.org.
      * remove library issues list from daily report, and supply a link to cp.org issues list that is replacing it.

* Last week:
   * Heads down on GameBoy hacking. It’s come a long way including GameBoy Color support, more stability and more displayio-compatible API. Actually kinda playable.
   * Worked on Language Summit presentation. Just need to practice and refine.
* Next two weeks:
   * PyCon!
      * Language Summit (Wednesday)
      * EDU Summit (Thursday)
      * Helping with Registration (Friday)
      * Open Spaces (Friday - Sunday)
      * Python Art event - The Interface play (Friday)
      * Mentored Sprints (Saturday)
      * Nina keynote on (Sunday)
   * Week after: 4.0.0 stable?
      * Good to be around in case bugs are found.
      * Thoughts?
