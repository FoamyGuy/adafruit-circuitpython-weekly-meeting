Video is available here [on YouTube](https://youtu.be/JPNQX99cxws).


Join here for the chat all week: https://adafru.it/discord


The weekly happens normally at 2pm ET/11am PT on Mondays. Check the #circuitpython channel on Discord for notices of change in time and links to past meetings.


CircuitPython development is sponsored by Adafruit. Please support them by purchasing hardware from https://adafruit.com.

## Community News
  

Discord now offers "server boosts" we have 4 on our server (level 1), if we get to 10 boosts we get a banner and some other good features for the community: 150 emojis, 256 Kbps audio, server banner, 50 mb uploads for all members. Stop by and boost!  https://adafru.it/discord 


Adafruit.io monthly is here! Adafruit IOT Monthly: Azure IoT meets CircuitPython, build an internet-connected wearable love pendant, and more! -
https://io.adafruit.com/blog/notebook/2019/06/06/iot-monthly-june/ 


Reminder 8/8 is CircuitPython day, a group asked if it was OK to have the event/etc. On that weekend, yep! 8/8 is a Thurs … Sat/Sun or any time is fine :)

## 23:02 Status Updates
39:01 @brentru 
* Last week:
   * ESP32SPI got some mock-methods
      * You can now use DigitalOut/PWMOut-like API methods with any board with an ESP32 attached. 
         * Useful for stuff like GPIO Expansion (smaller M4, less GPIOs exposed? Use an ESP32), twiddling bits, and more!
   * CircuitPython_RGBLED released
      * Super high level RGB LED manager, similar methods and compatibility with pre-existing NeoPixel library
      * PWMOut objects, PCA-based PWM expander, SysFS PWMOut (Blinka, coral boards, orangepi, etc)
* This week:
   * Early this week: Currently working on bringing up (physically) two new boards which we haven’t leaked yet 
   * Exposing the RGB LED work, within WiFi manager - useful for seeing the status of your HTTP requests on the AirLift FeatherWing, Breakout, etc.
   * Giving our old RaspI/BBB + DHT guide blinka code, rework.


@cater - Lurking


40:24 @charlesburnaford 
* Looking at revising keyboard code to use new 23017 library. Checking it out to try and address a few artifacts
* Playing around with an idea at work at the weather center, trying to use CircuitPython


@dakotah.redstone - Lurking


41:41 @danh
* Implementing BLE Scanner. Moved advertising parsing code to Python. Testing now.
* Then central and BLEHID
* Continuing to update BLE library and bleio.


@DonK - Lurking


43:19 @iraytrace
* Working with ssd1306 feather, there are a bunch of unexposed features that they’re investigating adding, like scrolling and partial updates. 
* @tannewt says that some or all of those features are done or coming soon from displayio
* Working on a BNO05 VR app that would normally use bluetooth and instead is using an itsybitsy and BNO05


45:45 @jerryn
* Tested out some new Airlift Feather wings
   * Added one to a Grand Central M4 -- nice test platform!
   * The SPI WiFI Coprocessor is really working out well
* Still trying to find time to get back to BLE, LoRa and displayio projects


24:49 @kattni
* Last week:
   * MCP9600 guide done
   * Worked on MCP9600 CircuitPython driver - failure. The temperature byte is 24 bits, not the 16 I was attempting to read.
   * Put aside MCP9600 CircuitPython driver until we can sort out the I2C incompatibility with CircuitPython itself
   * Forum support
   * Started wrap up blog post for PyCon
   * Met with Microsoft interns regarding VSCode CPX simulator they’re working on - will be available as an advisor throughout the rest of their process. They’re two weeks in and it looks great!
* This week:
   * Running CircuitPython weekly - finish up everything that goes with that
   * Library Monday
   * Forum support Tuesday/Thursday
   * PyBadge/PyGamer general purpose wrapper library - PyBadger
   * Finish up blog post for PyCon
   * Start/finish second blog post

      * Fixed script typos. Now successfully runs the script. However…..github perms are blocking a direct commit push.
   * RosiePi:
      * Got the main “build and upload firmware on-demand, run tests” framework complete. For awesome log sample: https://gist.github.com/sommersoft/f975309ce1d187677f0efa36c19f91a8
      * Running tests and interaction is in-work. Raw REPL is nice, but `tools/cpboard.py` implementation is a bit limiting at this point.
      * Setup the bones of the dev environment for an accompanying RosiePi GitHub App.
* This Week:
   * circuitpython.org/libraries:
      * Either fall back to submitting a PR vs a direct commit, or iron out the perm issues.
   * RosiePi:
      * Work through some changes to `cpboard.py` or RosiePi-side interaction with Raw REPL, to run tests.
      * Continue working on the GitHub App...or learning how to GitHub App rather. :D


36:17 @TammyMakesThings
* Writeup and code for the Feather and a NeoPixel at  https://github.com/tammymakesthings/fw_neopixel_pride
* Designing a CircuitPython/Maxbotix LV-EZ4 sensor for my car to avoid running into the wall when I'm parking at home, because I have bad depth perception.
*  Getting my first 3D printer this week, which I'm very excited about.


36:54 @tannewt
* Almost done with partial screen updates. Just one bug (hopefully) to track down.
* Will continue to work on gaming related things this week including gameboy.
## 46:55 In The Weeds


47:15 @jerryn - future plans of ATControl library/guide and Guide for ESP32 SPI Coprocessors
* Should we continue to support AT_control for Argon
   * My recommendation -  drop it - an Airlift featherwing on a Feather M4 is a much better approach.
* If we are going to keep it, should the library be updated as much as possible?
   * @kattni says it will be left as is for now
* Should the guide be revised to focus on the ESP32SPI interface?
   * @kattni sez no work is being done on revising it now, chances are the guide will be deprecated
   * @brentu sez he can update the Airlift guide to add needed things from the ATContol guide. He will depreciate the old guide


51:42 @MakerMelissa
* Now that CircuitPython 4.0.1 stable is out, what is the plan for moving forward the rest of the displays to Displayio? (monochrome,eInk, etc)
   * @tannewt doesn’t have concrete plans but would like to see it be done
   * Need to figure out MIPI vs other command sets 
   * Also figure out pixel shader’s negotiation of what the final bit depth is
   * eInk is tricky because it’s more like two one bit displays instead of a 2 bit display, makes things harder. May need parallel pixel shaders to handle outputting to the different “displays”
* Regarding scrolling
   * Think of it like a large page/canvas with window that scrolls around it
   * @tannewt: display memory maps are an additional wrinkle and some built in scrolling is one direction
* @tannewt and @makermelissa and others interested will work together on a plan
