@mr certainly (lurking)


23:55 @roy (Lurking only today)
* @kattni for all sorts of amazingness at PyCon.  There are so many reasons she deserves hugs for all the hard work. For the patience she showed everyone at the open spaces and sprints.  For the amazing job putting together boards for people to work on at the sprints.  For the amazing tutorial at the Microsoft booth.  For announcing the sprints.  For transporting all the stuff to the sprints.  It would not have been the same without her efforts.
* @danh, @tannewt, @makermelissa, @brubell and @siddacious for helping make the sprints awesome with their passion, patience and friendliness with everyone.
* All of the people I saw everywhere learning CircuitPython for the first time all over PyCon on their brand new red CPX!  Welcome to the family!
* To Adafruit and Digikey for sponsoring the CPXes for all attendees of PyCon.
* To @makermelissa for making the PyBadge buttons work so my badge could be interactive at PyCon and for helping Kattni build the list of boards to order.


24:52 @siddacious
* @danh @roy, @kattni, @makermelissa, @brubell, @tannewt @nnja, and everyone else at PyCon for an amazing first experience. You guys made it irreplaceably awesome
* @makermelissa for sharing her PyBadge code and helping me investigate/document a hardware issue. Also for some great one on one chats
* @Roy for being awesome, taking pictures and being a pleasantly chill contrast to the con insanity
* @tannewt for taking the time to meet and chat and check in about my first month at adafruit
* @kattni for kicking butt at all things, not limited to 
   * Planning and organizing and generally being the backbone of adafruit’s presence at PyCon.
   * Running a great workshop at the Microsoft booth, giving hands on help to people to get them jump started with CP

## 35:15 Status Updates
@cater (lurking)


53:09 @cgrover (has mic)
* Crash course on displayio, making progress
* Testing range slicer proto, made itsy m4 dev board for it with stemma connector and battery connection
* Changes before the range slicer is moved to the PCB; sticking with frambuff for now because 
* Updatesd stemma boards, dac work well with neotrellis m4, great for eurorack translations
* Designed 2  boards: 16 bit dac and arbitrary waveform generator, leveled up soldering skills to get it working. Featherwing format. Great for generating accurate note frequencies
* Excited for driver work
* Finishing up range slicer


56:31 @charlesburnaford
* Out in the midwest working around tornados
* Doing some data modeling


57:12 @danh
* PyCon for 6 days + traveling + prep + followup
* Reviewed lots of 4.0.0 rc PR’s
* Tuned @godlygeek’s bounds checking PR
* Tested fix by Guido to Python IDLE editor to sync after file writes
* Found that double precision float libraries were accidentally included in builds with FrequencyIn, got them to go away again
* New work updates incoming


59:54 @deshipu (not in meeting)
* Taking a break from CircuitPython, feels too much like a second job


1:00:00@Dylan H - 
* Since Pycon, I’ve been working mostly on the CircuitPython GPS module. I initially was working on some bug fixes and then went on to expanding some documentation. Now that I feel I understand the module and the NMEA protocol that it uses a bit better, I’ve been working on adding support for parsing more types of NMEA sentences from the GPS. I’ve finished all but one and will probably make a PR in the next day or two. 
* I forgot to mention this in my hug report, but I’d like to thank @kattni and @MakerMelissa for helping me with Travis and Github, and an especially big thanks to @siddacious for help with Github, Travis and for some amazing help with the GPS module I was working on.


1:00:57 @Jerryn
* Spent a little time testing RC.2
   * Found one issue that broke the SD Card library

40:04 @roy (text only)
* Finally managed to put together repos with the final parts needed to wrap up _pixelbuf work:
   * _pixelbuf compatible neopixel.py
   * _pixelbuf compatible adafruit_dotstar.py
   * A pure python _pixelbuf drop-in for non-express boards and other low-flash devices so that they can use the same neopixel.py and adafruit_dotstar.py drivers as other boards with _pixelbuf
* Began the discussion with Scott, Dan and Kattni on how to roll out the changes, and will continue it with them later today.


40:38 @siddacious
* Last time interval
   * PyCon!
   * Pybadge hacking and battery meter - may be dealing with some bugs or misunderstanding around labels and bitmaps
   * BD3491 CP driver draft and LPS35 bits on the plane to PyCon
   * BD3491 bringup after much 
* This week more BD3491 driver work and test board work


42:35 @sommersoft
* Last Week+:
   * adabot
      * The final urllib3 fix to CVE-2019-9074 was released, so that PR is in.
      * Removed the open issues & infrastructure errors from the daily report; it now just points to the cp.org libraries contributing page.
      * Tweaked the `update_cp_org_libraries` script to fix the Travis-specific code that checks if the current day is the scheduled day to run.
   * circuitpython-build-tools:
      * Removed the exclusion of `__init__.py` from being mpy-cross'd
      * Restructured how the list of files to bundle is gathered. Now walks the entire folder, so that sub-folders are included. Also uses a supplied prefix string to identify package folders.
      * Had these changes merged in during PyCon, which immediately started breaking builds during sprints. After a sizeable backlog was created, changes were reverted.
      * To help avoid further occurrences of the above, wrote some tests into the `.travis.yml` for PRs.
      * Fixed previous changes; now defaults to 'adafruit_' to avoid updating EVERY .travis.yml.
* This Week:
   * adabot:
      * Finish setting up Travis & adabot so that automated updates work on cp.org.


46:30 @tannewt
* Last two weeks
   * Lots of gameboy hacking pre-PyCon. Got the color going but still have bugs to fix. Definitely interested people in it.
   * Language summit presentation went really well. I think it blew some minds how small the micros are.
   * The Interface play went well.
   * Open spaces went well thanks to the others.
   * Helped Nina with her talk. It went well and live demos were good. Got some newcomers afterwards.
   * PR merges and fixes for RC.2
* This week
   * Follow up on a safe mode crash Nina found over the weekend.
   * Take a first stab at dirty rectangle tracking to speed up the display.
   * Out next Thursday to the following Wednesday for a wedding and visiting my Grandma.
   * Recording a Podcast.__init__ episode on Thursday and need to reply to the PyDev of the Week email.
