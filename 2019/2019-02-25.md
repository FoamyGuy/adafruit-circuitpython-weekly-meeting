# CircuitPython Weekly for 25 February 2019

## 4:23 Community News (@adafruit / pt)
* Digi-Key + Adafruit at PyCon - will have Circuit Playground Express for all! AND! The CircuitPython team will be running several Open Spaces sessions (as they did last year), showing how to use CircuitPython on the Digi-Key / Adafruit PyCon special edition Circuit Playground Express. We’ll have extra addons to play with also: potentiometers, NeoPixel strips, and servos. The team will be running a CircuitPython Sprint for several days to work on CircuitPython libraries and CircuitPython core code. BYOMUSB “Bring your own Micro USB” cables, we’ll have some to borrow during the sprints/sessions, as well as some USB C adapters, good idea to bring one too! http://adafruit.com/pycon 


* Check out Nina's fantastic talk @ PyCascades: Light Up Your Life - With Python and LEDs https://t.co/XpUUbyFJQb & https://t.co/HRaMLq40qv


* adafruit.io for CircuitPython is here. We are thrilled to release the CircuitPython wrapper library for communicating with Adafruit IO! - https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_AdafruitIO

      * Any other examples I can think of will be added to IO CircuitPython
   * Brought @adafruitio back to life - working on getting it tweeting again

@CGrover - Group hug today. Still working the details of my first CircuitPython class library. The class is working – just adding some controls and decorators. Working on the hardware design first really helped me develop the class UI. Will continue working on that project, sending PCB design off later this week. Lots of snow shoveling planned, as well.


@charlesburnaford - MIDI mouthpiece code for my ocarina demo using a mcp single port analog pressure sensor


31:10 @danh
* Continued minor fixes on big build refactor
* Rename some u* modules (ujson, uerrno, ure) to their CPython names
* Hide bleio classes that won’t be in 4.0.0
* Verify Windows nRF UF2 bootloader issue; test fix
* Will document nRF bootloader updating
* Will fix Atom fsync plugin to work on all drives, not just CIRCUITPY
* Continue bleio testing
* Cleanup for 4.0.0 beta and rc releases
* Pyportal crash debugging


@Jay Doscher - lurking 


34:32 @jerryn
* Last week
   * Continued testing ESP32SPI
   * Fixed some issues with ESP_ATcontrol
   * Tested Adafruit_CircuitPython_AdafruitIO
   * Tested a bunch of featherwing stuff (rtc,gps,alphnum,sevenseg)
   * enables default bus support for particle boards
* This week
   * Porting wifi-manager from ESP32SPI to ESP_ATcontrol - almost done.
   * Updating Co-processor Guide
   * Still hoping to find time to work with BLE and displayio ….


22:43 @kattni
* Last week:
   * Library Monday - updated CP lib tracking issue
   * Finished Getting Started with BLE and CircuitPython guide - in moderation
   * Mostly finished VEML7700 driver - attempting to test interrupt functionality and it’s not working, not sure if it’s me or the driver (presuming it’s me). Mostly documented otherwise, and nearly ready for PR.
* This week:
   * Library Monday!
   * Starting PyPortal guide
   * Update CharliePlex guide with FeatherWing/Bonnet, deprecate MP version
   * CharliePlex bonnet guide
   * Code for a Noe and Pedro project
   * VEML7700 and VCNL4040 fritzing objects
   * Continue driver work


25:04 @MakerMelissa
* Last week:
   * Did a lot of repo level cleanup. I added all missing drivers that currently have documentation and organized alphabetically.
   * Did some more work on my learning guide.
   * Finished up Ultimate GPS FeatherWing
   * Finished up 8x16 LED Matrix FeatherWing
   * Regression tested all FeatherWings that I had to see if any problems had crept in and fixed them.
   * Updated RA8875 Examples to work with multiple screen sizes better.
* This week:
   * Finish up my learning guide for the RA8875
   * Work on adding more FeatherWings starting with the CharliePlex FeatherWing
   * Moving related stuff, so time is a bit limited

26:37 @siddacious
* Last week:
   * Added support for 16 bit 565 and 555 and 8 bit grayscale BMPs to OnDiskBitmap
   * Got a feather M4, ESP32 and AM2315 posting data to AdafruitIO to start helping my gourmet mushroom farmer neighbor automate his grow houses
* This week
   * Hum/temp data collection for the above, initial plans for automation
   * More bitdepths to OnDiskBitmap
   * More playing around with displayio


27:10 @sommersoft
* Last Week:
   * adabot:
      * Forced the reports to use unbuffered stdout to hopefully mitigate the 10 minute idle Travis failures.
      * Changed Travis build to a matrix; bundle update is now one build, and reports a separate one.
      * Tried and couldn't duplicate the newline issue when pasting report output into Google docs. I tried pasting in Chrome, Edge, and Firefox. And also copied from AWS in browser, .txt file, and the terminal. Don't have access to Mac, so that could be where the issue lies. I can still add `\r` to the line endings if needed.
   * FrequencyIn: 
      * Continued re-gluing work. Got through the new `circuitpy_` config part; much nicer way of doing things (thanks again @danh). Still fighting a couple compile errors; either some other things changed or I didn't update my backup files before nuking the out-of-date branch.
   * Started working on a fun Pirate translation, after @CGrover mentioned it last week. Not going to do the entire translation, as others have mentioned a desire to contribute. I know it was a joke, but I think this is beneficial from a education standpoint. What child (like myself) wouldn't love to interact with hardware that talks like a pirate? Even if it is talking only with error messages, learning what not to do is just as important.
* This Week:
   * FrequencyIn
      * Keep pushing through compile errors.
   * adabot:
      * Issue list grew last week, so I'll probably start attacking some of those.
   * Pirate translation: 
      * Get a little more done then PR it so others can careen it a bit.


28:48 @tannewt (not in meeting)
* Added support for risking file corruption in favor of sharing writability of the file system.
* Reworked translations to make diffs smaller but it likely needs a bit more thought. Also added script that re-merges translations from the git history.
* PyCascades this weekend and sprints today. Hence, missing the meeting. Lots of awesome folks. Sprint doc is at: http://bit.ly/circuitpython-pycascades2019-sprint
* Will be out after sprints for just over a week. Have lots of family in town and will be spending time with them. Brain will be freer afterwards. Thanks everyone to continue to rock while I’m out.


## 37:10 In The Weeds

38:00 @jerryn - I2C pin conflicts with some of the helper libraries (featherwing,Motorkit) may already be in work.
* Issue posted to FeatherWing library - take a look. Reconsider shared.py? Jerry has a workaround but wants feedback.


42:23 @sommersoft - move ESP8266 AT support to the community bundle?
* Split AT support between the main and community bundle


46:38 @brentr `namedtuple` instead of `dicts` in adafruit.io libraries? Regular Python library uses namedtuples; CircuitPython library current uses dicts.
* Dict scheme sounds pretty good, less overhead.
