## 31:40 Status Updates
@anecdata (lurking)


@AnneB (lurking)


49:47 @CGrover (text only)
* Last week:
   * Designed and tested a semi-automatic Stemma device discovery scheme. Here’s the process: A device catalog module containing a dictionary of device names, descriptions, and their individual import, instantiation, and test statements is created and stored in the file system. A configuration discovery function imports the catalog and tries to establish a device instance. After walking through the device catalog, the discovery function shares a list of successfully attached devices. The scheme is useful but not universal since it would be difficult to maintain and synchronize a large number of device definitions. However, it’ll be a time-saver for small projects that need a bit of Stemma device flexibility -- like my sensor-testing robot platform. May also be helpful when I forget a device’s fussy instantiation parameters. PyPanel Device Discovery Test     Discovery Function Code
   * PCBs oh my! Simultaneously assembled and tested four PCBs. Although they were functional and useful, some improvement opportunities were discovered; three of the four were redesigned. Hurrah for OSH Park and OSH Stencils!
* Next week:
   * Write a blog or guide about the RobotFriend project and resultant PyPanel concept. Learned too much in the process of to not take the time to document and share.
   * Wrap-up the clothes dryer duct temperature visualization project.
   * Start (no more than) two PCB assembly projects.
   * nWrap-up the panel/enclosure design for the Euro VCO and workbench Waveform Generator projects and laser ‘em.


@charlesburnaford (lurking)


51:30 @danh
* Finished internal flash storage layout PR.
* Fixed nRF internal filesystem bug: a variable was not `volatile`.
* Subscribing to all the MicroPython issues/PR’s paid off: I remembered they had fixed a gcc9 problem that we also encountered.
* Next up: BLE bonding for real, really.


@DaveP (lurking)


@deshipu (lurking)


1:02:33 @Drew Fustini
* Added PWM support for Pocket Beagle, now supports BeagleBone Black/Green etc. to work with Blinka


@dherrada (lurking)


53:17 @Hierophect
* Work on supporting the STM32 Meowbit, which has ended up being kind of hairy
* Review of bootloader options and linker system for flash memory updates
* Tested/reviewed issue with USB related to VBUS management
* Ordered a variety of new stm32 boards to add to Circuitpython post-meowbit


57:26 @hukuzatuna (text only)
* Status: job hunting and reviewing issues for bits I can help with. Contemplating porting Sphero RVR SDK to CircuitPython


@jasonp (lurking)


57:48 @jepler
* Last week:
   * Ironed out some MP3 playback issues, including ID3V2 tag skipping
   * Ditto some MP3-specific stereo playback issues on SAMD51 DAC
   * Uploaded an initial version of JEplayer fka pyrockout to github
   * Continued trying to diagnose Dar-Scott’s troubles via github
   * JEplayer functionality: folder-as-playlist, background images
   * Ran into some DMA lockups on samd, seems to occur when playing sound AND updating display (I say that because I don’t think it locked up before I added the progress bar, though other onscreen text was being updated in a version that was solid for 40+ minutes)
   * Ran into performance problems trying to show BMPs from SD on pygamer, specific to rotated LCDs
* This week:  some of the following -- anticipating 20 hours approximately:
   * Work on the nRF RawSample looping bug, which was just escalated in priority 10 minutes before the meeting :)
   * Wireframe of JEplayer’s screens for @adafruit, so he can get me some icons
   * Diagnose and maybe even fix DMA lockup *OR* change JEplayer to avoid it
   * Look into fixes or workarounds for the BMP performance problems
   * Find out whether a hack for approximate seeking in mp3 files might work
   * Polish and then schedule an adafruit blog post (my first!)
   * Starting with STM slipped last week, will probably slip to past new year’s,
* Ongoing fun projects:
   * Design phase for 3d-printed keyboard with “tenkeyless” (TKL) layout, top design is done, bottom design might start this week.
   * Need to identify the right microcontroller board, it needs about 23 digital I/Os for keyboard scanning, plus I want I2C for an OLED display, CircuitPython, and bluetooth. Nrf52840 feather plus seesaw?


1:00:09 @jerryn
* Last week
   * Submitted PR to RFM69 and RFM9x libraries to facilitate using interrupts for received packet - in review
      * Thanks to @pythonaire on github for suggesting it.
   *  Stumbled across 2  tricky issues with some boards file systems under CP5
      * Seriously impacted non-express nRF52840 boards
      * Now fixed by @danh and @tannewt -- all good
* Next week
   * Hope to add some examples to RFM69/9x regarding use of the Radiohead headers. The support is there but no examples. You can use them to filter packets an essential address units individually if there are multiple units in range.
   * Possibly work on adding “reliable datagram” mode




32:30 @kattni
* Last week:
   * Finished the STEMMA OLED fritzing objects
   * NeoPixel_SPI deployed to PyPI
   * Updated MCP9600 guide with Python usage
   * Verified no other guide updates were on hold for the same reason as MCP9600
   * Added default files for PyPortal Titano to GitHub
   * Finished the Circuit Playground Bluefruit NeoPixel Animation and Color Remote Control guide
   * Blogged updated and new guide releases
   * Started updating the Circuit Playground library to have a board-agnostic import mechanism that allows for single examples to work on both Express and Bluefruit.
   * Replied to an issue reported with the AudioOut guide code in the CPX product guide that turns out is a known issue on Bluefruit
   * PR in to update comment in audio code to clarify.
* This week:
   * Library Monday!
   * Update CPB NeoPixel Animation guide code to make streaming color prints optional to speed up code when used with a display Gizmo attached to the CPB.
   * Continue updating the Circuit Playground library and begin updating examples to use new import
   * Feather e-ink Friend fritzing object
   * Fritzing objects for two new portals
   * Update pyportal guide to include pynt
   * Creating a new guide for the pyportal titano, which is different enough that it needs its own guide
   * Next up, some motor projects.  Adafruit has lots of hardware, but no code is posted anywhere.


@KingerNorth (lurking)


37:57 @krayola
* Last week
   * Assembled the christmas tree lights with @kattni

   * physaCI's first Azure billing cycle ended. Invoice total: $0.01. Granted, this is only based on development activity, but still nice to see that a major goal in my design (low-cost) seems to be panning out so far.


* This Week:
   * Adabot
      * Finish Blinka stats/info.
      * Add board count for both the core and Blinka.
   * RosiePi/physaCI

46:11 @tannewt
* Released Beta 1 this week and followed up with a couple bug fixes.
* Lots of reviews of awesome code.
* Got PacketBuffer and AMS fully sketched out but now debugging.
* This week will be splitting AMS and the other BLE libraries out into separate repos. Will rough out BLE MIDI as a way to test PacketBuffer as well.
* Will release Beta 2 as well with the bug fixes from last week.
* Need to apply to the PyCon 2020 CFP. Ends 12/20


## 1:03:00 In The Weeds
1:03:39 @jerryn  -- CPB file system corruption -- is it just me or is it happening a lot


1:08:32 @tannewt - Heads up on #circuitpython2020


1:11:46 @hierophect - trying to decide the ideal way to advise people on getting code onto the Meowbit


1:19:41 @hierophect - quick question for @tannewt, how to handle packages vs boards


1:24:29 @tannewt - holiday meeting schedule. Maybe skip 12/23 and 12/30 in favor of 12/27? Regular programming starting 1 / 6?
* Notes-only edition on 27 December 2019


1:28:11 @jerryn - will the beta2 filesystem fix break all current non-express filesystems?
* @danh - only maybe nRF
