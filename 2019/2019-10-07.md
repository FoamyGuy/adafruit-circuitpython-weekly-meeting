Happy Ada Lovelace Day! TOMORROW!
Ada Lovelace Day (ALD) is October 8, 2019, it is an international celebration of the achievements of women in science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM). It aims to increase the profile of women in STEM and, in doing so, create new role models who will encourage more girls into STEM careers and support women already working in STEM - findingada.com.

## 24:45 Status Updates


40:07 @brentru
* Last Week:
   * CircuitPython and AWS IoT (aka: one of the last large cloud-provider integrations, for now!)
      * Spent majority of last week hacking apart and learning about the nina-fw burned into the ESP32 “airlift” boards
      * Did some work on nina-fw’s WiFiSSLClient to allow a device .x509 certificate and private key.
         * Also useful for managed ENT network envs.
      * Wrote a better Makefile for nina-fw workflow, reflects ESP-IDF’s workflow with some extra, circuitpython-specific, steps.
      * Connected successfully to AWS IoT with hardcoded device cert&key.
         * Running out of RAM when a key is provided, MBed’s SSL setup process uses a lot of RAM.
            * Long-term, some type of native ssl client for circuitpython would be very useful. Not just for WiFi, useful for other transports too.
* This week:
   * Some non-cpy things on Monday
   * Solving the RAM issue with the ESP32
      * Once unblocked - PR’ing my certificate work on nina-fw along with an updated release of ESP32SPI which will allow users to store a certificate on CircuitPython FS.
   * guide work for AWS IoT after - another planter, most likely :)


@cater (lurking)


42:46 @CGrover
* Last Week:
   * Prototype Stringcar passed test with Alpha 4.
   * Unbodged version sent to OSH Park. 
   * Designing M4 version.
   * Used different 2MB flash chip, but will submit design later.
* This Week:
   * Wrap up DAC project.
   * Domino Carrying case


44:24 @danh
* Finished debugging the XAC-compatible gamepad support. After updating tinyusb to the latest release, it now works! Tested on an Xbox.
* Adding support for LittleFS for BLE bonding meant refactoring VFS code, which got quite convoluted. Also started moving `re` and `json` to shared-modules, which also became rather involved. This is akin to discovering that a loose bathroom tile requires a complete gut and renovation. I’ll implement bonding with FatFS for now and divide and conquer all the refactoring work.


46:26 @DaveBriccetti
* Students
   * Bubble sort in the style of the [Hungarian dancers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyZQPjUT5B4)
      * Many of my students wanted to be “number 8” :-)
* CPX sound
   * In creating [Tilting Arpeggios](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_CircuitPlayground/blob/b6a8e5f915906c414039a478570fef44e4365ef7/examples/advanced_examples/circuitplayground_tilting_arpeggios.py), I discovered some improvements that could be made to the Express class in the Adafruit_CircuitPython_CircuitPlayground library to address uneven volume, and delays between notes:
      * Using a square wave instead of sine produces more consistent volume throughout the frequency range, saves around 200 bytes of memory, and avoids the concern that 100 samples per sine waveform exceeds the 350,000 samples per second limit and must be reduced for notes at and above 3,500 Hz. 
      * Not calling stop and deinit on audioio.AudioOut after playing each tone, and then regenerating the waveform, avoids a substantial delay between notes.
   * I created a [customized version of the Express class](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_CircuitPlayground/pull/71), and added support for square and triangle waveforms, and for setting volume (a float value from 0 to 1). You can [see and hear the results](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1VUJFcSD30).
      * There’s a real strangeness when using the square wave, though. It seems to foul up the timing. You can hear it in the video above. It’s as if using it breaks time.monotonic.
   * With [this updated version of Tilting Arpeggios](https://github.com/dcbriccetti/Adafruit_CircuitPython_CircuitPlayground/blob/tilting-arpeggios-update/examples/advanced_examples/circuitplayground_tilting_arpeggios.py) ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6BqcLrgjTY)) I have met my own needs (by fixing performance and using a square wave).
      * I ran into memory issues, which went away when I merged several Python classes into one
   * If there’s interest in updating the Express class, I’m happy to do it, or to help.


49:14 @deshipu (text only)
* Helped on the MicroQiskit CircuitPython workshop last Friday at the Quantum Day in Zürich. (at the end of https://qidis19.b2match.io/my/agenda )


@dherrada (lurking)


53:00 @Hierophect
* Last Week:
   * Working on SPI Flash
   * Hopefully will be added to new boards
* This week:
   * Working on UART
   * Wrapping up DAC


50:36 @jasonp
* Last week:
   * Still making sense of Bitmap, Palette and other displayio details to chase down transparency behavior
* This week:
   * Prepping for new board we are developing: SAMD51 + Intel MAX 10 FPGA
   * Brainstorming ideas for BLE NeoPixel-based wedding decor lighting


25:40 @kattni
* Last week:
   * Went through All the Issues™ to identify Good First Issues and created 20+ new issues for Hacktoberfest
   * Reviewed and merged various PRs
   * Successfully tested the FT232H in VMware Fusion on Mac OS
   * Finished the Circuit Playground Bluefruit Bluetooth examples: Playground Color Picker and Playground Bluetooth Plotter
   * Completed the STEMMA Speaker guide, fritzing object
   * 2.9” eInk breakout fritzing object
   * TFT Gizmo fritzing object
* This week:
   * Library Monday!
   * Get final approval on CPB Bluetooth example pages
   * Touch base with Justin about finishing updates to circuitpython.org/libraries/contributing
   * Update Trellis guide to have CircuitPython/Python usage/examples
   * Revisit CircuitPython OLED watch
   * Deprecate a list of guides and point them to updated versions of the guides
   * Update PyPI spreadsheet - all applicable libs appear to be on PyPI, but the bigger part of that project was updating the guides with Python/Linux usage, and that was not completed. Much of it has been done since the last time the spreadsheet was updated, so I need to update it to get a visual on what we really have left to do.
   * Deprecate motor and servo Python library repositories
      * Start with PCA9685


30:10 @krayola (missing meeting)
* Last week:
   * Fixed adafruit_dotstar.py and neopixel.py to work with the latest _pixelbuf work.
   * Made Travis not hate me my new-pixelbuf-api branch of circuitpython!
   * Mostly made _pixelbuf.PixelBuf subclassable and promptly broke both of the _pixelbuf compatible versions of adafruit_dotstar.py and neopixel.py!
   * Made Travis hate me again on the new-pixelbuf-api branch.
   * Spent too much time trying to figure out what I broke in _pixelbuf when I was trying to setup a Metro M4 with my segger to debug, when in fact the NeoPixel featherwing was just not happy in the Terminal Block Breakout FeatherWing, even with a level shifter. https://www.adafruit.com/product/2926
   * Discovered it's apparently not straightforward (but apparently should be?) to call a subclass method from a native (at least not during slicing (subscr)) and spent a lot of time in the debugger.
   * Discovered that I can't just ignore slices with step > 1 in _pixelbuf because there are plenty of examples that use [::2] and similar around (hi @kattni).
   * Discovered that _pixelbuf also needs to be iterable.
* This week:
   * Continue to try to make _pixelbuf.PixelBuf be able to call .show() on a subclass during auto_write=True or come up with a reasonable alternative approach
   * Make PixelBuf iterable
   * Work to support slices with step > 1
   * Add a native .fill() to PixelBuf
   * Update my branches of neopixel.py and adafruit_dotstar.py to be compatible with the latest and greatest _pixelbuf.
* Sometime after this week:
   * Continue hardware compatibility testing
   * Work on pypixelbuf to make sure hardware that doesn't fit _pixelbuf can still do neopixels and dotstars.


31:56 @MakerMelissa
* Last Week:
   * Finished TFT Gizmo Guide
   * Got the Travis Tests working for Arduino Circuit Playground Bluefruit PRs

   * Added TFT Gizmo Example to Arduino Arcada library
   * Tested out a couple PRs for CircUp
   * Started working on writing examples for RGB Display on the Raspberry Pi
   * Tested out Carter’s SPI_Neopixel PR on the Orange Pi and got that working
* Next Week:
   * Finish writing RGB Display Examples
   * Start updating Display Guides with new Python pages
   * Review any relevant PRs.


@Mike B (lurking)


@Mr. Certainly (lurking)


33:17 @ntoll (missing meeting)
* Last week:
   * Various minor circup things (see https://github.com/adafruit/circup/commits/master for a good summary).
* This week:
   * It’s a Mu-rathon (that joke will never get old). Basically, I’m spending my time code gardening on Mu. If folks have feedback, feature requests or other Mu related stuff, this week would be a good week to tell me. ;-) Thank you..!


33:50 @siddacious (offline, please read)
* Last week: lsm303 driver wrangling
* Travising/PyPi-ing of CircUp
* Received and assembled my keypad pcbs
* This week: lsm303 drivers, bringing up more boards


34:08 @sommersoft (text only)
* Last Week:
   * Finally got circuitpython-org/libraries.json properly deploying to S3.
   * Adabot:
      * Worked out a quick script to iterate through our repos, and apply the Hacktoberfest label to open issues that are marked as "good first issue".
      * Added that script to the daily run of 'circuitpython_libraries', so that any additional issues that come up are processed during the month. Further, the Hacktoberfest label will be removed after the event ends.
      * Expanded 'validate_contents' to search subfolders in 'repo/examples'. Allows empty top folders (if they have subfolders), and ensures files in subfolders meet the standards.
   * Circup: Fixed an issue with deployments to PyPI.
* This Week: 
   * I’m not sure yet. I’ll hunt for something.


35:00 @tannewt
* Last week:
   * Heads down on BLE.
      * Got Central and Peripheral merged into Connection.
      * Scanning and advertising merged into Adapter.
      * Creating a service no longer requires a Peripheral object.
      * Finding a balance between the magic to do away with UUIDs and using them in _bleio.
      * Realized scanning should return an iterator so that results can be looked at as they come in. Makes forever scan loops possible and enables data broadcasting over advertising much more responsive.
   * Fixed issue with outdated BusDevice being frozen in.
   * Also, fixed board inclusion script to actually fail when one is not included.
* This week:
   * More BLE.
      * Bug hunt the ScanResults iterator.
      * Factor out a function to check whether an exception (ctrl-c or reload) is pending to break out of the forever loop.
      * Debating whether iterators are also the best way to buffer incoming packets.
      * Get examples working again and submit PRs.


@Thea (lurking)
## 55:00 In The Weeds
55:37 @danh
* 55:38 Consider removing unused ports from CPy source tree? I have been saying “no” on this for a while due to upstream merges, but I am tired of grepping for things and seeing irrelevant code.
* 1:02:37 We use the unix micropython port for testing, but it knows nothing about circuitpython. Consider forking that port to make it more CPy-specific?
1:06:49 @DaveBriccetti
* Sound
   * 1:06:50 Why would using a square waveform (apparently) break time.monotonic?
      * sleep_time = next_note_play_time - time.monotonic()
   * How does sound generation work in the background? Interrupts?
      * _audio_out.play
* 1:09:50 General tips for reducing memory use?
   * Scott answers with a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baa5ILZTRkQ)
1:16:12 @deshipu
* What is pewpew13 in the download stats, and how come it has some downloads even when it doesn’t even appear on the downloads page?
   * @sommersoft: I noticed that last night..I’ll look into it.
      * Looks to be coming from the build assets. Can’t dive any further right now… (day_job)
      * Looks like it was created in April by Phillip? https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython-org/commits/master/_board/pewpew13.md
