CircuitPython 5.0.0 Beta 0 released!
This is release 5.0.0 beta.0. Beta releases are largely feature-complete, but are meant for testing. Use the latest stable 4.x release when first starting with CircuitPython. When you find a bug please check the current known issues and file an issue if something isn't already known. 5.0.0 is the latest major revision of CircuitPython. It features many improvements and enhancements to displayio, including grayscale OLED and e-paper displays, extensive additions and changes to BLE support, support for the STM32F4 and Sony Spresense microcontrollers, and PWM audio support. Downloads are available from circuitpython.org! The site makes it easy to select the correct file and language for your board. The downloads page is here:

Nice post up at Embedded Computing Design:
"...it was especially neat to run into Scott Shawcroft, who was introduced as pretty much being “CircuitPython,” the language that’s used to program the Adafruit Edge Badges that we received. These badges are conveniently set up so that when plugged in you can open up the program as a text file and make modifications."

Overall: Dan released 5.0 beta 0, has new bleio changes in it. Getting closer to seeing 5.0 as stable. Cool stuff with BLE. Please play around with the new changes. Let us know what you find. If you have random BLE devices around your house, let us know what you have.

@cater (lurking)


@cgrover (lurking)


38:45 @charlesburnaford
* I don’t have a whole lot. 
* I started an interesting thing - found an article about tearing apart an old toy keyboard and creating your own MIDI controller out of it. Working on that.


40:20 @danh
* Revised all the current Learn Guide CircuitPython code to match the new API. Will be showing up soon as PR’s are approved and merged.
* To do: will be trying out some BLE light bulbs to see which we can control easily.


@JacobT (lurking)


42:07 @jepler
Last week:
* Verified that CircuitPython builds with gcc 9, but some firmware sizes grew too much.  Because of this, it may not be possible to accept the PR at this time.
* Worked on a PR to reduce time spent in background tasks.  Need to determine whether this PR causes a regression in USB performance.
* While trying to benchmark USB performance, found a crashing bug on nRF52840 boards when bulk copying data with `dd`.  Fixed and PRd.
* Chased down several different bugs in the nRF I2S driver and opened 3 PRs as well as a fresh issue.
This week:
* Get @tannewt’s opinion on whether to finish and accept the gcc9 PR, or close it without merging
* Finish benchmarking USB speed and hopefully get the background tasks PR merged
* Continue to shepherd #2299 “Supervisor: create code.py file with sample code”
* More stuff; I unexpectedly got the nRF I2S stuff to PR status this morning, had expected it to take more time.
* Definitely won’t work Thursday, but still intend to do 16-20 hours this week
Ongoing fun projects:
* Making a 3d printed keyboard (“sick-68”) - This week: Hoping to complete the row wiring.  (Controller will be a teensy 2.0, so no CircuitPython inside.  In the next keyboard for sure!)
* Working on an edge lit digital display - This week: finalize and order PCB layout


45:53 @kattni
* Last week:
   * Finished up eInk Gizmo guide
   * Updated CPX examples to not use `simpleio`
   * Refactored the Circuit Playground library and added support for Bluefruit
      * Added two new features to the `bluefruit` module: `loud_sound` and `sound_level`
   * Closed out some GitHub issues
* This week:
   * A few fritzing objects
      * OLED display STEMMA revs
      * Feather eInk friend (coming soon!)
   * Update Bluefruit guides where needed from Dan’s updates
   * Update my first ever guide! (Piano in the Key of Lime. It is woefully out of date.)
   * Fix typo in Essentials guide on Servo page
   * Short week this week - should be around through Wednesday. Travelling over the weekend.


@KingerNorth (lurking)


50:32 @krayola
Last week:
* Continued working on _pixelbuf subclass support.  Submitted a PR for Scott and Dan to look at that no longer breaks the unit tests.
* Did a bit of work to make NeoPixel and Dotstar libraries work with the new pixelbuf API.
This week:
* Add iterable support to _pixelbuf
* Add C .fill() to _pixelbuf
* Clean up NeoPixel and Dotstar subclasses
* Do compatibility testing of NeoPixel and Dotstar modules
* Sync pypixelbuf with _pixelbuf


52:10 @hierophect (unable to make meeting this week due to holiday travel)
Last week
* Various bugfixes to SPI, worked on DisplayIO issues
* New MCU definition for the STM32F401, used in the Meowbit
* Added board definition for Pyb Nano board (STM32F411)
* Worked on board definition for a “blackpill” generic F411 board, encountered boot issues
This week
* Out for thanksgiving, will check discord for questions


52:44 @MakerMelissa
* Last 2 weeks:
   * Worked on Testing and Reviewing EdgeBadge Code
   * Updates the fritzings in a couple of guides that were waiting on the Beta release of CircuitPython
   * Started going through and updating some libraries using displayio to work in CircuitPython 4 and 5
   * Attended SuperCon
   * Got back fromSuperCon on Tuesday
   * Reviewed some PRs
   * Added E-Ink Gizmo to Gizmo library and wrote example
   * Wrote Arduino E-Ink Gizmo Graphics Test example
   * Added E-Ink functionality to ImageReader Library
   * Subclassed E-Ink code in ImageReader Library
   * Wrote Arduino pages for E-Ink Gizmo Guide
* This Week:
   * Catch up on some outstanding Pull Requests
   * Update PyBadger Code to handle external fonts better
   * Go through and update IS31FL3731 Charlieplexing guides


@mscosti (lurking)


18:46 @ntoll (leaving early)
* Last week:
   * Added tests to the radio module.
   * Wrote up what I did here: http://ntoll.org/article/circuitpython-tests
* This week:
   * Long[er] messages (a 10 minute fix done via https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_BLE/pull/33).


54:20 @sommersoft (not in meeting)
* Last week
   * Mostly travel prep and travel.
   * Bits-n-pieces of physaCI’s Azure functions.
* This week
   * More travel.
   * Bits-n-pieces of physaCI. Maybe.


@stargirl (lurking/offline)


31:34 @tannewt
* Back from Supercon on Monday.
* Jumped in and added pairing back. Got Apple Notification Center Service demo going and BLE HID working with Mac.
* Working Mon-Tuesday and off and on after that. Have an Apple Pie to bake.
* Helping JP with this week’s BLE hide and seek project.
* More BLE HID debugging and test out using other BLE HID devices.


## 54:45 In the Weeds


55:00 @jepler
M0 boards, translations, and the future.  Keeping CircuitPython within the constraints of these smaller devices is getting harder, and something we would really like to add will push us over the edge sooner or later--we seem to be at just 24 bytes free on pirkey_m0 with zh_Latn_pinyin translations right now. (this translation uses up ~2400 bytes more than the english original)


Possibilities I considered:
* In 6.x, drop translations for the most constrained boards. (but support the boards themselves)
* Declare 5.x the last version for M0s (or just non-Express M0s) and continue to bugfix 5.x for longer than other past versions (e.g., 5.0 is an LTS, at least for M0s)
* Find a way to push translations to filesystem
   * @danh: We have discussed this a little bit. Another mild advantage is that it would cut down the number of builds
* Find a substantial improvement in message compression
   * @danh: Currently we use Huffman. I have looked for a C library that does dictionary-based LZ compression, with the dictionary shared across strings, but haven’t found one. All the libraries are oriented toward streaming rather than run-time decompression of a set of strings. Some tiny experiments I did indicated we might get up to an x2 improvement in total message size (I compared current Huffman-compressed total message size with size of a gzip file of the same messages).
* Scott’s ideas include:
   * compressing qstrs
   * Compressing RAM strings
   * Types take a lot of storage


1:01:10 @jepler
Small focused PRs, or more stuff in fewer PRs?  Did I file too many about the nRF audio stuff?


1:03:13 @krayola
I'd also like to discuss the subscr signature change (See PR https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/2034)


1:10:15 @krayola
I'd like some guidance on how to write some automated tests for _pixelbuf.
