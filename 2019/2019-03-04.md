CircuitPython related events coming up
PyCon 2019 returns May 1–9, 2019 to Cleveland, Ohio. Adafruit + Digi-Key is a swag bag sponsor (Special edition red CPX), we’ll also be doing open sessions and more, stay tuned for the blog / Discord for more.


March 11th, London, UK. Meet, learn and share ideas about MicroPython. Nicholas Tollervey will be telling us about the latest features of Mu - a free code editor for Python, MicroPython and CircuitPython devices.


KiCon is a KiCad user focused conference. Held for the first time ever, April 26th and 27th 2019 in Chicago IL. Adafruit is a sponsor - kicad-kicon.com

## 25:20 Status Updates


35:00 @brentru
* Last Week:
   * Release/bugfixes for CircuitPython Adafruit IO
   * NEW CircuitPython Guide: PyPortal IoT Data Logger with Analog Devices ADT7410, Adafruit IO and CircuitPython Using the Analog Devices ADT7410 and CircuitPython to create an IoT Temperature logger
      * https://learn.adafruit.com/iot-pyportal-data-logger-adafruitio-circuitpython
* This week:
   * Been working on a building a PyPortal IoT weather station
      * LOTS of i2c sensor breakouts - SGP30, BME280, VEML6075, and even an anemometer (using the analogin adc) 
         * Hopefully will serve as an example/reference for using Adafruit IO CircuitPython and DisplayIO together.
   * Working on another guide, non-circuitpython related.

37:00 @cgrover - text only
* Wrapped up the Range_Slicer CircuitPython library yesterday and am celebrating the successful completion of my first multiple-instance class today (with coffee and speculaas cookies). The class was derived from a synth project that needed to emulate a rotary switch with a potentiometer. It evolved into a general-purpose analog value converter that compresses or expands the input value then quantizes it into a collection of precise output slice values. The class detects input value changes and applies selectable hysteresis when slice edge thresholds are reached to eliminate noisy dead-zone issues, all without any internal delays in the code. 
* Applications include converting rotary knob position to MIDI control or note values, analog signal noise processing, as well as level detection and display. Have successfully tested up to 6 simultaneous instances with one of John Park’s projects and will be using it as the primary processing algorithm for a new Eurorack module.
* Next step is to test it with 16 simultaneous instances on the Grand Central M4 Express board. I also want to try replacing the linear algorithm with some non-linear processes that could be used for things like decibels, dew-point, and pH. I may get distracted by using it to create a NeoPixel strip/array color organ with multiple analog inputs and overlapping color zones.      No  –  Must. Finish. GitHub. Documentation. First.


39:20 @charlesburnaford
* Finished MIDI ocarina. Going to build mouth organ


39:28 @danh
* Fixed PWMOut TCC bug (thanks to @kevinjwalters for spotting it)
* Fixed displayio refresh hang when trying to auto-reload
* Reviewed lots of PR’s
* To do: finish cleaning up and fixing a few more issues for next 4.0 beta release


40:20 @dastels (text only)
* PyPortal alarm clock project is done, guide is written. Just putting finishing touches on it and prototyping a case in cardboard.  All CP. It turned out nicely, although faster/optimized screen update will make it nicer.


40:28 @deshipu
* Cleaned up and merged the pewpew 10 code and board
* Working on a version of PewPew for a large conference, secret for now
* Got the PewPew working as a USB gamepad
* I finally got the Hallowing going and will test displayio


@jasonp (lurking but may post text)


41:19 @jerryn
* Spent lots of time trying guide examples on the PyPortal.
* Found an issue concerning SPI conflict with displayio
   * Impacts use of SDCard on Py Portal 
   * Impacted test of STMPE610 with displayio and tft featherwing. 
* Released updated ATControl with Wifimanager
* Next week -- keep trying things


@Josh - lurking


26:17 @kattni
* Last week:
   * Finished writing VEML7700 driver
   * Finished writing VCNL4040 driver
   * Finished PyPortal guide
   * Finished code for Noe and Pedro’s project
   * Completed driver for the MCP9600
* This week:
   * Library Monday!
   * Potentially get hardware for MCP9600 and test driver
   * Make Fritzing objects for VEML7700 and VCNL4040
   * Update CharliePlex guide to work with breakout/FeatherWing/Bonnet
   * Write CharliePlex Bonnet guide
   * PyPortal project?


@KingerNorth (lurking)


@ladyada:
* pyPortal and Graphics stuff. Created lib for shapes in ladyada repo - Display_Shapes
* Display button UI element, text with different outines etc, basic UI elements, hypercard buttons - live with it!
* PyPortal demos - soundboards
* Update to Display Text in ladyada fork - to center text and create text bounding boxes - adjusted text entry point - right justified etc. - calculate width of string of font - Text Area and Display Bitmap Font - kind of breaking, needs testing!


28:00 @MakerMelissa
* Last Week:
   * Didn’t have much free time last week due to moving
   * Made some progress on my RA8875 Guide
   * Fixed some bugs in the RA8875 library and got those merged in
   * Did a few Code Reviews
   * Found a bug in CircuitPython that was crashing it into Safe Mode
   * Made some changes to the FeatherWing library to avoid I2C conflicts, but haven’t committed code yet.
   * Played around with PyPortal for a bit
* This Week:
   * Still won’t have much free time
   * Try to actually finish guide this week if time allows
   * Do finish up FeatherWing library changes and commit code
   * Work on some new FeatherWings as time allows


29:17 @MikeBarela
* Not had as much Python time. If y’all might know the Python on Hardware newsletter comes out Tuesdays, means Mondays are busy.
* A little time with PyPortal - images from Star Trek (mainly ToS) - will be adding to FAQ that display cable came disconnected.
* Guides!

32:30 @siddacious
* Last Week:
   * BMP bitdepths
   * Mushroom farm datalogger & AIO integration
* This Week:
   * Driver work
   * More IOM (Internet of Mushrooms) work
   * Finally assembling the new board. Boooooo USPS


@sommersoft
* Last Week:
   * adabot:
      * added import checks for renamed `ure`, `ujson`, and `uerrno` modules.
      * updated `-v` command arg to ensure `validate_contents` is always run [first], so that bundles that are in-work are not included in validator results. Does not run/output full results unless explicitly included as a validator.
   * FrequencyIn: PR is in!
* This Week:
   * circuitpython-build-tools:
      * Work on folderizing example files
   * adabot:
      * Look into library insights results showing zeroes


33:24 @tannewt
* Still very much on vacation so no work since before pycascades.
* Folks in town for a couple more days
*  


34:28 @TG-Techie
* A lot of little things - tricorder is unofficially done, works, all the things are doing the things. In a functional state. Revision to MoBo want to make, but don’t need to
* Commit the GUI since it is from all testing stable - release as beta.
* Another kid at school hooked on CP, been wonderful to see


## 43:10 In The Weeds


43:40 @jerryn  -- only if time and if considered appropriate since this is not an Adafruit boards
* Ran into issue with using EN pin on particle Xenon
   * 3.3 V only drops to 1V when EN grounded
   * Would appreciated if someone can reproduce/confirm
   * Seems to impact CP startup -- goes to Safe mode if EN used for power control
   * No problem if just using USB for power
   * Discovered when using xenon on tft-featherwing - on/off switch uses EN


50:50 @quantumobstruction - Jetson TX2 for Blinka support.


52:30 @tg-techie - porting new architecture, issue is IO vs code. FPGAs, would it be legal to implement the io register map from ATSAM to a core that runs RISC-V? Issue is that it’s complicated - start with IO that’s been attached to RISC-V to begin with. 
* 55:10 Linux has a device tree driver for embedded systems to specify the peripherals, is that an idea?
