# CircuitPython Weekly for 25 March 2019


Video is available here [on YouTube](https://youtu.be/YOrY36IByj0).


Join here for the chat all week: https://adafru.it/discord


The weekly happens normally at 2pm ET/11am PT on Mondays. Check the #circuitpython channel on Discord for notices of change in time and links to past episodes.


CircuitPython development is sponsored by Adafruit. Please support them by purchasing hardware from https://adafruit.com.


Reminders: Podcast available on most services. Let us know if we’re missing some.

## 3:05 Community News

CircuitPython in the news: Make: Magazine, Python is “Tech Trend #1” … “IEEE Spectrum Magazine - Scott Shawcroft Is Squeezing Python Into Microcontrollers”, HackSpace Magazine featured multiple projects and boards which use CircuitPython. Disrupt Yourself Podcast had a segment on PyPortal, and Cool Tools interviewed Sophy about Circuit Playground, including CircuitPython - all of these are on the blog as well as the latest newsletter shipping Tues.


Many of the CircuitPython team members will be on a hackchat on hackaday.io April 3, 2019 at 3pm EDT. We'll have more details and links once we get them, see you next week!


“4-H grows confident kids with life skills to thrive in today’s world & succeed in their boldest dreams tomorrow.” About a year ago Adafruit started the process of working with 4H to have an official 4H-branded version of Circuit Playground Express. We applied and were notified in mid-March we were accepted! This means millions of kids are one step closer to Python on hardware.


Downloads are now available from circuitpython.org! This site makes it much easier to select the correct file and language for your board. The downloads page is here. We could use some help with filling in the text for the various boards.


And vid/talk from last week now posted “Embedded Programming for everyone using MicroPython and CircuitPython” by Ayan Pahwa https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/03/24/embedded-programming-for-everyone-using-micropython-and-circuitpython-by-ayan-pahwa-fa_voc-iayanpahwa-fossasia/


## 6:15 State of CircuitPython + Libraries

### 6:38 Overall

* 15 pull requests merged
  * 9 authors - applio, caternuson, s-light, dhalbert, makermelissa, jerryneedell, mikerenfro, kattni, tannewt
  * 7 reviewers - ladyada, jerryneedell, kattni, dhalbert, tannewt, brentru, makermelissa
* 13 closed issues by 8 people, 18 opened by 9 people


Overall: We’re still working steadily towards 4.0 release candidate. Thanks to everyone who has been testing and finding bugs. The best thing you can do to help right now is use CIrcuitPython Beta5 - the more use it gets the more bugs we’ll find. There are plenty of projects posted to Adafruit’s Learn system that utilise many new libraries designed to work with `displayio`. If you have the hardware, run these projects to test the new libraries as well - we’re working to get them all as solid as possible.

## 19:41 Status Updates

35:29 @ATMakersBill - listening in
* Success with XBox Adaptive Controller, but found out there’d be a delay in Microsoft fixing their issues.  Talked w/Dan about how to best get our workaround into CP.
* Example of success (you’ll smile): https://twitter.com/at_makers/status/1109591462130434048 
* Dan suggested an issue, so I wrote one up.
* Also, working on a button-based PyPortal project to create a Speech Generating Device based on Open Board Format - targeting Wed’s Show & Tell.


27:40 @brentr
* Last week:
   * Published a few guides
      * PyPortal Thermometer: https://learn.adafruit.com/pyportal-smart-thermometer-with-analog-devices-adt7410-adafruit-io-and-circuitpython/overview
      * PyPortal  Email Display
      * https://learn.adafruit.com/pyportal-email-display/overview
   * Started a few projects
* This Week:
   * PyPortal IOT Scale Project
      * Hacked apart inexpensive DYMO scale, building out a library for it and adding some CircuitPython Adafruit IO code :) 
      * hacking apart existing hardware to communicate with them with CircuitPython
   * PyPortal Smart Lighting Controller
      * Hacking on a HTTP API - which isn’t Adafruit IO
         * Spent most of friday hacking on the LIFX wifi smart bulb API with ESP32SPI and the PyPortal. 
      * Control these smart bulbs with a PyPortal
      * Code can probably be modified/ported to 


29:04 @cater
* DRV2605 work, wasn’t running through all possible examples, never been updated to use new-style API. It’s not using all 8 of possible slots to store waveforms.
* Displayio stuff, playing around with that, lowlevelish, examples trying to understand various parts of displayio API. TileGrid, ran into issues - opened issues on that.
* ADS1115 ADC - PR open. Fast rates, wanting to bash on that a little.

* Reviewed a number of core PR’s.
* 

33:16 @deshipu
* Two new shields for D1 Mini: GPIO expander and accelerometer
* Final prototype for the secret conference done
* Working on Polish translations
* Made a simple Snake game for the Hallowing: https://github.com/deshipu/hallowing-snake to test the displayio API (if someone wants to make a guide out of that, feel free), tried Tetris as well, but it’s too slow for that.


@jasonp - lurking


37:14 @jerryn
* Not much time this week or next week

23:54 @MakerMelissa - text only
* Last Week:
   * Got my first Learn Guide Published
   * Wrote example code for the ILI9341 displayio Driver and fixed the repo so it passes Travis
   * Added additional Displays to the ST7735 displayio Driver Such as the MiniTFT and 160x128 displays and fixed that repo so it passes Travis.
   * Added code example to the Seesaw Library to work with the MiniTFT Joystick FeatherWing
   * Wrote the ST7789 Display Driver.
   * Wrote my first CircuitPython PR to allow ST7789 driver to work. It’s still awaiting code review
   * Wrote an SSD1351 Display driver, but it’s being a bit finicky still
   * Code Reviews and Testing the Button and Shapes libraries
   * Worked on my PyPortal Calculator a little more. Mostly updating
* This Week:
   * Try and get the SSD1351 Display Driver Functioning
   * Write the HX8357 Display Driver

25:25 @sdw_nj - lurking read notes
* Two weeks ago
   * The goal was to get sigrok_meter running
   * Fedora Linux doesn’t provide the Python bindings for libsigrok that sigrok meter needs
   * I set out to modify the spec file (the file that drives rpm package creation) to create the python bindings and ultimately create a new sub-package.
   * I was eventually able to configure it to create Python 3 bindings and create a new libsigrok-python package (and I added “+py” to the version differentiate it from the official packages). I’ll look into how I can make that available to others.
   * Sigrok-meter is now working so a future goal is to grok how it works.
* Last week
   * I bought a cheap logic analyzer (a clone of an old Saleae design) and accessories including a serial breakout.
   * I set out to learn about sigrok’s PulseView software to be able to analyze communication between my DMM and computer.
   * I will continue to attempt to gain more understanding of PulseView as well as the protocol my DMM uses.
* Future
   * Logic analyze all the things!


26:30 @siddacious
* Last week: LPS35HW board
* This week; lab re-org and LPS35HW driver


26:49 @sommersoft
* Last Week:
   * nRF PDMIn: got through buffer management, but am getting unexpected results. Trying to narrow down if it's my misunderstanding of the built-in decimation/PCM formatting, or a problem with my buffer management solution. The one example I've found that uses the PDM periph, is not designed for dynamic buffering and is really scattered so it's hard to ascertain. 
   * Did a few library releases, and a few PRs to facilitate new releases (finishing touches for PyPI)
   * Discussed adding an easy "updated libraries" list to adabot. Current method is manual using release notes/commit messages from the bundle.
* This Week:
   * Keep pushing on PDMIn.
   * adabot easy updated list

## 38:28 In the Weeds

39:04 @cater - 
* 39:07 Updating frozen motor in CPX w/ Crickit - manually pulled to latest versions with PR, updated this morning.
* 41:40 Library bundle download tie-in to webpage? - in the works.


42:55 @ATMakersBill
* How do we support XAC while Microsoft is broken? - Fork, build flag, or ?
   * Ok to use special build of a specific fork


51:20 @tg-techie 
* Referencing the same variable from inside of a function, and outside a function, getting different ID
   * Please post code to a CP issue
