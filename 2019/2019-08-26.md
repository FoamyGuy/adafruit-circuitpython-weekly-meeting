# CircuitPython Weekly for 26 August 2019


## NEXT WEEK: Meeting is on Tuesday 3 September 2019.


Welcome to the CircuitPython Weekly meeting notes! Feel free to add your notes for Hug Reports and Status Updates early. During the meeting, we go through them as a round robin sorted by username. If you can’t make the meeting and would still like to participate, add your notes with a “(missing meeting)” after your username and we’ll read them off for you. 


Add any longer-form discussion topics or general questions you have to the “In the weeds” section. 


Thanks! We hope to see you in the meeting!


Thank you to @siddacious for taking notes!


Video is available here [on YouTube]().

## 24:47 Status Updates


@anecdata (Lurking)


44:03 @brentru
* Built/released a good number of CircuitPython libs last week: binascii, hashlib, rsa (encryption), ntp (network time), json web token (authentication)
   * Took a while since most of these libraries work with each other, small bugfixes to RSA.
* Small updates to MiniMQTT for stability
* Finished google cloud iot core module
   * Building a project and a guide today, possibly into tomorrow
* Going to be online a _bit_ less, resuming classes next Thursday.


46:07 @CGrover
* Added digipot to synth to wave generator synth to make an ADSR envelope
* Driver work on the above
* Ran into playability issues, fixed with a keypress stack
* Going to re-introduce portamento for Star Trek theme playability
* Want to take a look at CP MIDI code


49:30 @danh
* Got BLE working on Circuit Playground Bluefruit after fixing a clock bug (bmeisels had independently discovered this bug earlier on a different board)
* Considerable work on BLE HID, adding features to bleio for its support and debugging. Now works on MacOS, Android, Windows, and Chromebook. Still debugging on iOS
* To do: Implement BLE bonding (it’s now faked); finish BLE HID


51:25 @DaveBriccetti (text only)
* I have started the grades 6–8 students at a school where I teach on Circuit Playground Express. They love it! Once they’re comfortable with the hardware and its features, using MakeCode, I will introduce CircuitPython. Our class web page.


@DaveP (Lurking)


51:49 @deshipu (Text only)
* No progress, waiting for PCBs.


52:16 @jepler
* Last week feels like a blur.  I didn’t have much CP time.
   * Helped diagnose a problem with variable-frequency PWM, was able to offer the user a workaround but it needs a fix (#2086)
* I’m on hand to help @sommersoft out with whatever’s left to get AudioMixer merged
   * @sommersoft, sorry I steered you wrong about the intrinsics vs portable code question
* Hope to tackle some or all of the following issues:
   * #1992 audioio does not maintain synchonisation of A0/A1 looping some audioio.RawSample data
   * #2005 CircuitPython 4.x hang on PyGamer after about 10 minutes of while loop playing stereo audio
   * #2058 Track DMA channel in use, don't rely on dma_channel_enabled (on atmel-samd)
   * #2078 nrf: pwmaudioout: RawSample always loops
* Past that, @ladyada has suggested I tackle nRF I2S Audio.  I will get the hardware ordered this week
* I have been learning gitlab-ci.yml for another project I’m working on.  Why can’t all the CI systems agree on a standard?!
* Need to figure out why I didn’t show up as a reviewer; I thought I reviewed this week! But maybe I’m doing something wrong.
* Fun project: Making a PCB to hook a Feather board to a Commodore 64


54:54 @jerryn
* Helped with testing and releasing updates to many libraries for a minor I2C change.
   * It went amazingly smoothly
* Tried some BLE stuff on my shiny new Circuit Playground Bluefruit - all good!
* This week Update my ble_rover -- I started doing this with an nrf52840 express/crickit, but also want to do it on the CPB/crickit.
   * Also getting back to receiving data streams from iPhone (accel/gyro) to control servos on pan/tilt or robotic arm


25:38 @kattni
* Last week:
   * Finished OLED watch guide - it won’t be rereleased until 5.0 is released
   * Finished Pylint guide - live
   * Started in on `stop=` kwarg PRs
* This week:
   * Finish the last of the `stop=` PRs.
   * Product guides - PDM, ATECC608, CPB
   * Remove support for 2.x and 3.x bundles
      * File issue on bundle
      * Remove 3.x backwards compatibility from libs
   * Sort out lib issues/PRs
      * Discuss with @sommersoft
   * Add note to CP Essentials AnalogIn page about getting pin values (Requested by Dylan with regards to the joystick values on PyGamer)
   * Add note to original CP libs tracking issue to see cp.org for further info, and unpin


@KingerNorth (HRs only, no status)


35:49 @MakerMelissa
* Last Week:
   * Finished up guide for Stream Deck controlled Message Panel
   * Created my first Fusion 360 design for the Message Panel project
   * Worked on setting up TensorFlow Lite on the Raspberry Pi 4 which involved a bunch of research.
   * Tested a couple of forum issues such as the eInk text not displaying correctly on a user’s display
   * Started getting setup for testing eInk PRs for Scott
* This Week:
   * Working on continuing TensorFlow Lite setup and learning about COCO models
   * Start writing guide for how to get TensorFlow Lite setup on Raspberry Pi
   * Testing eInk Pull Requests
   * Rewrite Display Button CircuitPython library to work like a Group
   * Anything else that comes up


@MikeB (Lurking)


32:29 @siddacious
* Did some finishing polish on the MSA301 drivers, and shipped the guide
* Assembled @kattni’s TLV493 protos for testing, made a pyportal into an i2c scanner
* Made progress on my keypad project
* TOURED PIXAR with the wife :)
* This week: More TLV testing and arduino driver
* Working through a literal pile of STEMMA QT protos
* Finishing Rev A of my keypad! For reals!
* Halloween costume brainstorming and initial prototyping


37:07 @sommersoft (text-only)
* Last Week:
   * MixerVoice
      * Addressed almost all of the review comments.
      * Moved Mixer & MixerVoice to a new 'audiomixer' module to allow more flexibility with builds.
* This Week:
   * Look into making Mixer changes backwards-compatible with 4.x.






37:30 @tammymakesthings
* Still not super available for CP stuff because I’m getting ready to move in less than 2 weeks. Looking forward to more space in my schedule after my move.
* Prototyping a script to help automatically update firmware and libraries on CP devices. I have a BUNCH of CPXs, ItsyBitsys, Feathers, etc, and would like a less manual way to update all of them when a new version of CircuitPython and/or the library bundle become available.
* Got an old Surface Pro 3 from eBay (for under $200!) and put Linux on it so I have a dedicated system for Python/CP development. Also downloaded the appropriate toolchain so I can build CircuitPython and got all that stuff working.
* I’m going to be presenting an intro to CircuitPython at a yet-to-be-determined upcoming meeting of DesertPy (https://desertpy.com/). Though I do a lot of public speaking on other topics, I don’t feel remotely enough of an expert to call myself a CircuitPython expert, but per Kattni’s PyOhio talk, I’m going to do this anyway!


39:30 @tannewt
* Spent some time looking into clang-format and clang-tidy. Will be more work than I’m willing to spend atm but pushed to my clang-tidy branch what I had.
* Wrapping up stop= PR and ePaper PR.
* Have to finish GitHub actions change. Got S3 upload working and now need to get release upload working along with website update.
* Been GameBoy hacking. Got Color working on GBC
* Catching up with Damien on Thursday.
* Headed to PAX on Friday. Hoping to chat with Noel, who helped make Celeste, Panic, who is making the Playdate, Kinda Funny Games, and noclip, who makes neat docs.

## 56:25 In The Weeds

56:59 @danh
* Circuit Playground Bluefruit - @jepler asked about CPX library compatibility, primarily necessary audio changes. How should we do this? Board checks in library? Multiple versions of library? It would be nice if no code changes are necessary.
   * @kattni: board checks will indeed bloat the lib and cause memory issues
   * Also need to figure out naming issues for imports with CPX vs CPB
   * Removing 3.x support will free up some space, maybe enough for board checks
   * @jepler has done some initial work refactoring the lib
   * @tannewt: want to make sure that the refactoring doesn’t end up with a funky RTD page
   * @danh: We need to consider the tons of documentation that may have to change
   * @tannewt: prefers one file per board
   * Moving to adafruit_circuitplayground.express import cpx as cp  for examples could make it easier to make code portable between boards
* Really simple CPB BLE support in a library?

## 1:10:41 Wrap-Up

## NEXT WEEK: Meeting is on Tuesday 3 September 2019.
