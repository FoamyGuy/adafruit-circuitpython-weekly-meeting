## 4:22 Community News
11,000+ humans in Discord, thank you everyone for make a welcoming place for all to share.


This is pretty neat, a person (Corey) did a PR & opened an issue for some MIDI control documentation and while they have been coding since 1982, they're new to Python and GitHub. After reviewing our guides on "Collaborating with version control" and "Contributing to CircuitPython with git and GitHub" they were able to successfully get their PR merged. CircuitPython may be one of the first places people get experience (in a good way) with GitHub and Python! https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_MIDI/issues/5 


Microchip is giving away 5 PyPortals on Tues 9am PT/ Noon ET here: https://youtu.be/0yxtECtDrCA 


Latest newsletter goes out on Tues, has lots of community projects, news, and more - have been reaching out via Twitter each week to add even more news from all things Python on hardware, please add yours! https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython-weekly-newsletter/blob/gh-pages/_drafts/2019-03-12-draft.md

### 8:10 Overall
* 25 pull requests merged
  * 13 authors - sommersoft, dhalbert, cpforbes, dastels, kattni, siddacious, demophoon, martymcguire, ladyada, makermelissa, willingc, jerryneedell, coreyostman
  * 8 reviewers - tannewt, ladyada, dhalbert, brentru, makermelissa, kattni, jerryneedell, siddacious
* 11 closed issues by 6 people, 16 opened by 13 people


Overall: 
Super close to RC on core side for 4.0. 21 open issues. 5 are translation related, the rest is bug hunting. Goal with RC is for it to be “stable”. 4.0 milestone needs to be squashed. Then we will RC, and let it simmer or squash any bugs that come up. Please use beta3 or the latest build on S3 and let us know if you find any issues!

## 27:30 Status Updates
31:51 @brentr
* Finished up pyportal weather station guide.
* Played around with PyPortal a little more. Email notifier.
* Bit of work on adafruitio for CP, added user string this morning.
* Starting to look at how MP does MQTT


32:47 @cater
* Couple of things. First forum thing that someone posted for DRV2605, we only show first page only of info. Simple cleanup of Learn and example code.
* ADS1x15 - related to continuous and operating at fastest conversion rates, there’s been various forum posts, people have cranked to highest conversion rate - all I2C traffic is going on with current driver. Can get it to run faster. How to cleanly and nicely implement that into the driver. The original issue was posted on Pi 0.


35:44 @CGrover
* Decided to rework the Range_Slicer library this past week to make it more universal rather than limiting to positive integers and only ordered inputs/outputs. Had to completely start over from scratch three times (or was it five times?) to approach the algorithm from different angles (thanks to my HS Physics teacher for the technique he taught me many years ago). Finally found the one I was looking for yesterday. It’s passing the tests! 
* Here’s an example of how Range_Slicer can quantize a relatively noisy potentiometer input signal (input: green trace, quantized output: blue trace). The Slicer class linearly processes any range of input values into a set of indexed output values.
* (posted image of graph into chat)
* Tasks this next week will be to complete the GitHub documentation, experiment with non-linear quantization and floor versus ceiling versus truncation methods. Will continue to develop the hardware prototype with the goal of sending the PCB and front panel design to the vendors by Friday. Planning to get deep into displayio for the relatively complex control panel display.
* Also, today is the big day for the CircuitPython-lighted UFO film miniature’s 15 minutes of fame. Green-screen filming begins in an hour. Hope that the production team will let me post a few video clips for you to see.
* (posted image of UFO into chat, and control panel)


37:57 @charlesburnaford 
* Finished the ocarina finally. Next is to work on mouth organ.


38:11 @danh
* Fixed `displayio` background display issues
* Debugging Chromebook issues and BLE crash issues
* 4.0.0 release final fixes and cleanup


39:05 @deshipu
* Working on a secret version of PewPew for an undisclosed conference
* Patch ready for adding default devices/pins to pewpew10 board and tweaking brightness
* Working on a business card that is also a shield for PewPew


@jasonp - lurking


40:51 @jerryn
* Where did the week go?
   * Helped with testing displayio/SPI issues
   * Quick fix to FRAM library
   * Spend a lot of time trying to help with rfm9x questions
   * Tried platformio example for feather_nrf52832 -- nice
* Next week -- probably unfocused attempts to test/break things ;-)
   * Try to find “hang” points in ESP32SPI -- hard to capture.


42:58 @kattni

14:50 @ladyada
* Text related: another PR update to do - Text_Area going to be called “label” and different based on origin point.
* All PyPortal examples will need to be updated - if your text is weird, that’s what it is. Left Center for however many lines it is - the text will float at the midpoint - bounding box will be centered at that point (within 2 pixels).
* Did a gremlin clock over the weekend
* PyPortal hacking over the weekend


49:21 @MakerMelissa

50:19 @sajattack
* Last week - Rust Trellis M4 Neopixels
* This week - Rust Trellis M4 Neopixels & Keypad
* Many weeks ago - Broken  circuitpython gif decoder
* Probably using circuitpython at some point when I need to check something against Rust


51:09 sdw_nj
* No code for the digital multimeter software project idea yet, just research.
* Found out that my Tenma 72-10405 is a rebranded Uni-Trend UT61B (https://sigrok.org/wiki/UNI-T_UT61B).
* Discovered QtDMM (http://www.mtoussaint.de/qtdmm.html) and purchased a DB9 to USB adapter (the Tenma usb cable is an odd HID based device).  I found a setting that works with my DMM.
* Discovered sigrok (https://sigrok.org/wiki/Main_Page).  They have a (seemingly rather new) project called sigrok-meter (https://sigrok.org/wiki/Sigrok-meter) which is written in Python.


52:00 @siddacious
* Last week: ina260 driver and board work
* This week: IOM work, more driver and board work


52:25 @sommersoft
* Last Week:
   * adabot.circuitpython_libraries:
      * Fixed an issue with the list of repos received from GitHub API search. It was dropping the more recently updated repos.
      * Added milestone remaining progress to core insights
   * Pushed my initial Pirate translation to get it started. Th' rumainin' will be finished by me hearties!
   * Started a board design for a Gesture Control FeatherWing. Using a MGC3030: https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/MGC3030
   * Started working on DeanM's MixerVoice PR (#1365, "add mixer voice objects and volume control"). I've brought it up to current master/config, after fighting some persistent compile errors. Got a working test up and running, late yesterday.
* This Week:
   * Continue with MixerVoice. Still learning the nuts-n-bolts of it. Then will start discussion on any desired changes.


28:07 @tannewt
* Back from vacation as of Thursday and caught up on emails. Let me know if I missed something.
* Got circuitpython.org live. Help need adding more content. Especially for boards. If you made a board please add info about it to the site. https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython-org
* Add filenames back to translation files.
* Going to fix auto updating files for website. Changed the format manually.
* Bug hunting for 4.0


31:00 @TG-Techie:
* Last:
   * Website development
   * FIRST robotics compromise was last weekend. Showed of tricorder and schmoozed circuit python, a little.
* Next:
   * Continue website development.
   * Add “docs” page to website for tg-libs.
   * Polish docs making script that pulls docstrings out of pycode. (As temp fix until I can get Sphinx fully Working)
   * Prep for release of tg-gui 1.1

## 55:00 In the weeds (Discussion)
55:30 @kattni: Would VSCode benefit from a Mu-like serial REPL built into it for CircuitPython users? - yes.


57:00 Other additions to VSCode to CircuitPython? - not really.


58:42 @deshipu: The SWD & SWC pins (PA30 and PA31) are all busy after reset in CP4, were working in CP3. Is that expected and can we bring them back?


@cater
* 1:03:22 will there be a guide for new 4.x displayio stuff
* 1:06:02 pin naming suggestion PyPortal.board.AUDIO_OUT -> .SPEAKER (to match SPEAKER_ENABLE, it's also .SPEAKER in CPX)
* 1:08:30 PyPortal has a board.DISPLAY, why not also a board.TOUCH, instead of just pins


1:11:50 @jerryn:   size of Bundle. Py version getting too big for 2Mbyte SPI express boards
         Any plans to break up.

1:14:40 wrap-up
