## 20:33 Status Updates

30:05 @brennen
* Mostly working on other Adafruit projects this past week, likely to get back into CircuitPython stuff this week.
* One PR for PlatformDetect stuff, more incoming.
* Reviews as needed.

30:30 @brentr
* Last Week:
* Not much circuitpython, but some python goin' on, workin on other adafruit things.
* Updated the #adafruit-io Python Client to include the Dark Sky Weather API integration (for IO Plus users!). API HTTP and MQTT examples added
* Adafruit IO Project with the Ruiz Bros that'll go live this week :)
* This Week:
* going back to working on LoRa & circuitpython things

31:18 @cgrover - 
* this week wrapped up STEMMA MIDI interface - trellis m4 with alpha5 code, simple but needed to connect to vintage controllers and eurorack. Few pcb projects to complete and AT tiny and arduino coding. Sent off for STEMMA backpack for I2C OLED display, publish this. 
* Back in recording studio on 21st. Will miss some meetings. Solo CD!

32:43 @charlesburnaford - 
* going to try to complete MIDI ocarina, and use USB and a canned voice to begin with and work on something a little more sophisticated. Hopefully get together with Scott to get some USB midi to test out.

33:25 @danh
* “Finished” and released initial BLE native module and corresponding Python level library
* Found out we need to support more than one type of SPI flash chip on 8MB boards; fixed.
* Fixed I2C issue on GC board.
* Fixed build issues caused by sphinx markdown updates; added better status reporting to builds in Travis.
* Reviewed a bunch of PR’s.
* Updated WIndows 7 drivers for new boards.
* This week, will add more BLE demos, add other simple BLE services, test, and debug, restructuring API and code as necessary

35:04 @deshipu
* no progress on the TextMode library, maybe I can do something this week, started work on a 2x analog joystick shield for controlling robots

35:57 @jerryn
* Last week
* Played with Grand Central -- reported I2C issue - (came from forum) - fixed by @danh
* Played with feather nrf52840 board
* Tested pulseio on nrf52840  with dht22 and IR sensor
*  Set up PIRKey to transmit my github token :-)
* Ran some BLE tests on nrf52840 boards. Found/fixed issue with beacon demo.
* Tried to get ESPRESSIF ESP32 board working with ESP ATControl - mixed results
* Next week
* Continued learning/testing BLE functions
* Continue experimenting with ESP ATControl

37:56 @josh - 
* this week have been working on CP EduBlocks editor, sent out to all patrons before Christmas, been playing with for about 4 weeks, bugs found have been fixed. Public beta for that this week. 
* Modal editor, for PC Mac for reg python stuff, everything one editor.

21:20 @kattni
* Last week:
* Finished Grand Central guide
* Added keypad support to CharLCD for the Shield and Pi Plate
* Completed library setup on a new lib
* Dealt with my initial experience with Eagle
* Got the PyPI download stats added to Adabot/newsletter
* This week:
* Library Monday
* Get someone to proof “The CIRCUITPY Drive” guide page in Welcome guide - publish once proofed.
* Add to CIRCUITPY drive page or otherwise - something about the difference between CIRCUITPY and BOARDNAMEBOOT
* Prop-Maker FeatherWing guide

23:50 @ladyada
* hiya current status is more wifi and displayio testing - grand central is shipping

@maker melissa - lurking

@mr certainly - lurking

24:07 @roy
* Pushed the latest changes to _pixelbuf, now ready for review.
* Tested the code with 584 dotstars and 32 neopixels!  So much rainbow!
* Finished up pypixlebuf (pure python _pixelbuf implementation) and pushed the pixelbuf compatible neopixel and adafruit_dodstar to github.  Feedback desired!
* Played with the 6-bit font code from featherwing and discovered the byte order on the flexible 8x32 and 16x16 neopixel grids alternate direction each row.  Realized there will be a need for pixel order remapping in _pixelbuf.
* This week hope to finish testing on more hardware (been using Metro M4 Express) and maybe even get _pixelbuf into some testers' hands.

24:37 @shawnhymel
* port CP to the sparkfun samd21 mini breakout boards, looking at doing sparkfun dev board next

25:08 @siddacious
* Last week: guide work
* Next week and until the heat death of the universe: guide work

25:20 @sommersoft
* Last Week:
* Adabot:
* Added Blinka to PyPi download stats. How did I miss that?
* Added total PyPi download stats, and re-fotmatted to a Markdown table.
* Catgeorized "needs release, new commits" by time elapsed since the oldest-new-commit.
* FrequencyIn:
* Changed the event action from RETRIGGER to COUNT. This helps fold @notro's counter in. Working out timing relations with the reference  and capture TCs (overflow, resolution, etc).
* This Week:
* FrequencyIn


25:57 @tannewt
* Got usb midi checked in!
* Got displayio and pyportal changes in.
* Text display from BDF works slowly. Two new libs bitmap_font and display_text.
* Working on shape rendering with an interlude to add support for subclassing native inits that take keyword args.
* 8 bit parallel displays support
* Likely more font work and optimizations.

28:36 @tg-techie - 
* progress has slowed since first robotics started, boards came in and got soldered up, all worked but one. Uses flash normally on metro and new flash. Work like baby metros. Thanks to everyone for jlink help. Next week - bugs in different board.

39:17 In The Weeds
* CircuitPython2019
* Format compared to last year?
* Highlights from other people’s posts.

* ESP8266 status - jerryn
* Fix or drop -- it does not work under 4.0 Alpha > 3 - Drop it.
* Boots, but the file system does not get mounted properly
* Read-only and empty
* Is there any reason to keep building it?

# NEXT WEEK’S MEETING IS ON TUESDAY, 22 JANUARY 2019
