#### Push the Button – a Handy Bluetooth Button
 Push the Button 

A wonderful collaboration between makers Sophy Wong and Blitz City DIY has produced the handheld “Push the Button” box. Inside the box is an Adafruit Feather nRF52840 Express board programmed in CircuitPython to take the button input and send commands out via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). When the box is paired with a mobile phone playing songs, you have a complete solution for controlling your tunes without having to touch the phone.
Sophy designed the case and cover with Blitz City 3D printing the case in yellow and Sophy milling one out of aluminum. The CircuitPython code is available on GitHub.
You can see Sophy’s video on the case design and the Blitz City DIY video on the electronics design - Adafruit Blog.

      * Proximity Trinkey guide
      * PAM8302 guide
      * ANO rotary encoder guide
      * Alarm light transistor powering guide

   * Fixed the Raspberry Pi Driver not turning on the backlight on ST7789-based displays
   * Fixed the Kernel Pinning Script to work on recent versions
   * Fixed 64-bit Raspberry Pi OS for Blinka Install
   * Added libgpiod Pulse_In for 64-bit Raspberry Pi OS
   * Looked into some issues regarding a potential SPI bug, but results were inconclusive so far

   * Possibly start a new guide


22:08 @mark(gamblor) [lurking]
* Off for a couple weeks so feel free to ping me if there’s something worth me looking at
* Left my job of 20 years last week (for a new job). Hoping I still have lots of CP time.


22:24 @Neradoc (no mic)
* Last week
   * submitted a PR for 3rd party bundles in circup
   * Advancing a generic macros library (running on macropad/keybow and generic keypad+neopixels with minimum configuration needed for each port)
   * Caught a cold (meeting with vaccinated people has its downside !)
* This week
   * More macros library stuff
   * Go back to libraries that should be in the community bundle (websockets, wsgiserver) and add them
   * Really start on mac keyboard layouts


@microDev: (lurking)


23:14 @tannewt
* Got CI changes in so that only boards related to a change are built. Pretty happy with it so far.
* Mainly working on tweaking BLE workflow to add modification times and moving/renaming. Should be the last bits to tweak. PRs out this week for both hopefully.
* Started an ESP32-S3 branch that first just updates to the latest IDF. May refactor it this week to enable non-ESP32-S2 builds. Should be similar to SAMD21/51 split.
* May also start on RPi if I have time. A break from BLE is welcome.


25:30 @WarriorOfWire [no mic]
* Renamed Tasko to CircuitPython_async
* Looking for help adding to community bundle and circup


25:53 @danh
* Debugged I2S audio quality issues on RP2040, which turned out to be an electrical problem, not related to software.
* Worked on remaining 7.0.0 issues.
* Looked at supporting HID boot-protocol devices.
* Assisting @dherrada with simple UART communication examples.


27:28 @foamyguy
Last week
* Finished up the printed parts for the etch a sketch and implemented the shake to erase with an accelerometer
* Made PR for changes inside cookie cutter to support a 3rd bundle option 
* Tested PR with new search / filter features for circuitpython.org
This week
* A few more “stretch goal” ideas for etch a sketch: saving images, traditional color mode, spirograph mode
* Get back into working on the Tiled map helper module. Try out an idea for a basic puzzle game


28:55 @jepler (missing meeting)
* Planning to work on 7.0 bugs if necessary
* otherwise improving parallel display to not require sequential pins on esp32s2
* Will be out the first part of the week for personal reasons


29:12 @jerryn
* Nothing to report.




## 29:40 In The Weeds
* @tannewt - How are we feeling about 7.0.0? What things do we want to fix before releasing it as stable?
   * @ anecdata (text-only) - the boot loop issue #5305 consistently (though intermittently) affects my "production" code on ESP32-S2 devices. The workaround is manual: physically put the device onto serial (if it's not already), go into REPL, hard reset. But if it doesn't affect anyone else, probably not worth holding up release for it.
