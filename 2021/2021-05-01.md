## 22:02 Status Updates
22:30 @jepler
* Last week:
   * Built mpy-cross for M1 macs (with quick correction/improvement from community member djix123 on github!)
   * Added Actions CI to verify that most ports can be built on Windows successfully & fixed some bugs
   * Started adapting esp32s2 camera capture code into CircuitPython
      * The code is for the Kaluga with OV2640 but we’re trying to use it with OV7670 since that’s what we have initialization code for
      * The code is not particularly stable (images are artifacty or shifted) on my Kaluga devkits with the official camera :-/ which is worrying
      * Using this code means I don’t have to worry about low level stuff like FIFOs and DMAs though
* This week:
   * Continuing with esp32s2 camera capture code
   * Have to wire up a custom proto shield, which just takes a long time for me
   * Will know soon if it works or not; hopefully it does work


24:29 @jerryn
* Still baffled by the tca9548a issue on rp2040
   * Logic analyzer shows that it is not sending commands properly. The channel switch is missing sometimes.
      * No idea why
* Ran into issue with HCSR04 (RCWL-1601) not working properly on RP2040 - OK in M4 - Opened issue in HCSRO4 but may be a CP (pulsein) issue.
* In response to a forum post, tried running a Airlift on an  Rp2040 Pico running Micropython -- using Blinka
   * MP does not have time.monotonic() -- had to revise library code
   * Ran into an SPI issue - unable to get it working so far.




27:16 @Jose David (missing meeting)
* Las Week:
   * Reviewing PRs. 
   * Working on BME280 and DPS310 Memory optimization
   * Some small docs updates
* Next Week
   * I will be on PRs land for one more Week.
   * Reviews if needed


27:42 @kattni
* Last week:
   * Published NeoKey Trinkey guide
   * Started Rotary Trinkey guide
   * Worked with Dylan on starting the move of the libraries from `master` to `main`
   * Finished up the Analog In template page
   * Tested a new feature in Learn
* This week so far:
   * Reviewed DPS310 PR
   * Continued working on Rotary Trinkey guide
   * Final testing of the Learn feature
* The rest of the week:
   * Finish Rotary Trinkey guide
   * PrettyPins for some SAMD21 boards
   * Factor out Simple Text Display from CLUE library into its own helper library


33:07 @MakerMelissa
* Last Week:
   * CircuitPython.org board updates
   * Started working on a new learn guide with speech recognition
   * I went through my guide feedback and made updates where applicable
   * I also went through the Google Assistant and eInk Calendar guides and redid the steps for Google Setup on the Calendar guide as they had completely changed.
   * Helped @kattni with adding arduino boards to check when PRs submitted
* This Week:
   * Working on learn guide for speech recognition
   * Taking a look at some of the Raspberry Pi Shell Scripts


34:00 @tannewt
* Took Friday and Monday off. Nice long weekend! Made some progress on Fiber Deserts too!
* Working on BLE workflow.
   * Added different advertisements based on bonding state.
   * Added 1 second wait for enabling BLE.
   * Working on USB/BLE file system sharing. USB will win vs BLE. User code access will follow existing API.
   * Filed an issue with Antonio about multipacket responses crashing. Will try to get them a build this week.
   * Testing all of the components via the test scripts. The original scripts didn’t handle reconnects that the real version has.
* Taking time off June 10th - 18th. Back on the 21st. No Deep Dive for the two weeks after this one.


36:36 @anecdata (text only)
* Off-the-grid: no internet for most of the next week or so


36:51 @danh
* Fixed some dynamic HID bugs encountered by @ATMakersBill.
* Working on native keypad support for simple keypads and key matrices.
* Released 6.3.0-rc.0. Will do 6.3.0 final today or tomorrow.
* PR to raspberrypi/pico-sdk to handle slow clock startup on some RP2040 boards.


38:48 @david.glaude (lurking)
* CP
   * Just chatting with CGrover about thermal cam (maybe a CP fatigue)
* Non CP:
   * Successfully used WLED [ESP32 Wifi LED animation] with Neopixel and Dotstar in 5V… but failed with the 12V led strip I did plan to reuse.
   * Playing with Docker on Pi4 with https://sensorsiot.github.io/IOTstack
   * Acquired 3m x 1.4m of reflexive fabric (Green screen trick with LED)


39:40 @foamyguy
* Last week
   * Implement guest user functionality on designio so that people can make designs without a user account
   * Research consumer codes for brightness and PR to HID library to add them
   * Possibly found a working solution for installing circuitpython-stubs from pip
* This week
   * Validate stubs install can work from test listing on PyPi. I was able to successfully install it locally. If this works then prepare a repo or whatever will be needed to get ready for deploying them.
   * Write some code for using a rotary encoder to send HID consumer codes.
   * 3D model a phone / tablet stand with a crank arm integrated
* ## 41:36 In The Weeds


41:40 @danh
* Consider dropping settings.py as an alternate name for boot.py. Not used in practice and can be confusing. A user had an innocuous settings.py that was overriding boot.py the first time he tried to use boot.py/
* Consider dropping boot.txt, code.txt, etc. and also checks for double extensions.
Conclusion: Yes, drop support in 7.0


45:27 @jerryn
I2C Rotary encoder (and Trinkey, I think)  -- there have been several comments about them “going the wrong way” The counts decrease when turned clockwise. Is this an issue or a “feature”


Conclusion: Report as bug in library, but consider whether it is a bug in seesaw as well.

## 53:24 Wrap-Up
Thank you for joining us for the Weekly meeting on Tuesday June 1, 2011.  The next meeting will be on Monday as usual, June 7 2021 at the usual time of 2PM ET.
