Display a Raspberry Pi Pico overlay in Adafruit AR - Adafruit Blog
A new feature in the Adafruit iOS AR app. If you have a Raspberry Pi Pico, you can now scan the board with Adafruit AR’s board scanner to display a pinout and power pin overlay. Adafruit AR is using image tracking to locate the Raspberry Pi Pico board, then it displays an pinout diagram overlay. Now you are able to see your pinouts even if your Raspberry Pi Pico board is on a breadboard!

@kevin_thomas (lurking, text only)


36:58 @kmatch98
Last week:
* Added interrupt pin checking to FocalTouch library to prevent errors when reading touches on a capacitive touch screen display.
* Updated sliding switch widget to conform to Widget and Control class draft definitions.  Added “orientation” and “flip” options.  Cleaned up animation function for easier code reuse. 
* Created a dial gauge display Widget (to 88 mph).
* Ported code (from Amiga era?) to bitmap ”blit” copy with rotation, scaling and clipping
This week:
* More testing of grid_layout
* Revise switch widget PR: Add width, height setters for use with grid_layout
* Document the draft Widget, WidgetLabel and Control classes so others can provide feedback and improvements.  (Sphinx?)
* Streamline dial gauge performance, more flexible with various angles, add height/width setters, publish initial widget. 
* Port the bitmap blit-rotate-scale-clip into the displayio core and compare performance


39:50 @makermelissa
* Last Week:
   * Got a guide on using CircuitPython with Home Assistant published.
   * Spent most of my time learning the ins and outs of ESPHome and HomeAssistant
   * Got it to compile with the ESP32-S2
* This Week:
   * Working on an I2C issue with ESPHome and the ESP32-S2
   * Looking into another issue with Raspberry Pi OS and the 1.14” Mini PiTFT Display


40:36 @microDev (text only)
* Working on NVM and busio.UART implementation for RP2040.
   * https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/compare/main...microDev1:nvm-rp
   * https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/compare/main...microDev1:busio-uart-rp


@Mr. Certainly [lurking]


40:58 @tannewt
* Made good progress on audio. Can playback single looped 8bit samples. Have to fix 16bit and then test with non-looped.
* So, more audio work. Hopefully will PR by the end of the week.


41:42 @TG-Techie
* Submitted a pull request to add “simple round rects” to adafruit display shapes, a more ram conservative but simpler round rect implementation.
* Looked around the displayio code for what i think is a bug but still learning my way around it.
* Had a friend agree to wear a watch as a beta tester to help reduce the four known bugs
* Found another solution to the ram limitations I’m having on the watch that I’ll be testing in the next week


@anecdata (lurking)


44:14 @askpatrickw 
* I am going to continue my work on the CookieCutter Library template hopefully finish by the end of the week. I lost my Mac during a Big Sur upgrade and had to get a new one so I’m going to be slow for a bit.


@cater (lurking)

@CGrover (just listening today)


44:35 @danh
* Working on secondary USB serial channel. Fixed a bug in USB descriptors that skipped an endpoint. This fix means that nearly all boards with at least 8 USB endpoints can support a secondary serial channel without needing to turn off any existing devices. Discussed Python API with @tannewt: we will probably add a `usb_cdc` to access the channel.
* Wrangling several bug fixes done or researched by others into the next beta, including RP2040 GP15, ESP32-S2 deep sleep wakeup state, and stalls when writing large files to CIRCUITPY.
* This week:
   * Fix SD card library to work with native `adafruit_bus_device`.
   * Investigate RP2040 I2C problems with a few devices; may be due to the way the libraries do I2C transactions.
   * Prepare next 6.2.0 beta.




48:06 @David.Glaude (lurking)
* PR and testing on PIOasm
* Playing demo of Gameduino GD3X Dazzle on HDMI

51:10 @foamyguy (absent for this section. Please read notes for me, and thank you)
* Last Week
   * Checked out several displayio related changes in the works: vertical progress bar, label baseline alignment, and DisplayIO_Layout structure classes and other examples
   * Looked into an issue resulting from fonts missing ascent/descent properties
   * Made a PR to fix building circuitpython when bitmap_font library is installed in the environment (thank you to @Jeff E)
* This week
   * Test out the display_text label scaling fix and leave a review on the PR
   * Revisit some of the above displayio changes to check out new things done since I last looked.
   * Look into a potential difference between Palette objects in Displayio_Blinka compared to the ones in the core.


52:02 @hierophect
* Last week:
   * Got started on I2C and low power issues
   * Just kidding, I actually mostly worked on Socket bugs
   * Fixed a set of issues with the Requests library
   * Re-wrote my testing sketches to do a better job of detecting issues across different timeout settings
   * Fixed other minor issues
* This week
   * Socket is basically done but I’ll be keeping an eye out for SSL bugs
   * Wrapping up the I2C issue
   * Reviewing low-power issues across the ports
   * I have some flexibility now so I’m up for any other higher priority issues too.
   * Learned how to make sourdough


53:47 @Hugo (Lurking)
* Last week
   * Some progress on the ProgressBar update, namely refactor
* This week
   * Finish up ProgressBar refactor
   * Add in support for vertical progress bar
   * Finish writing up instructions from @foamyguy on how to convert a library from a single module to a package with several modules (packages). Will pass along to @foamyguy to include in the “Creating and sharing a CircuitPython library” learn guide


@jasonp (lurking)


54:18 @jepler
* Last week: Learned some more kicad, freecad.  Read a novel & some short stories.  Cooked a bunch.  It was nice :)
   * I do have a trickle of locale compression improvements to bring in as we run out of space, ~200 bytes or so recovered in trinket m0 I think
* Two weeks ago: various, but I was most excited about making my first pull request into Adafruit Blinka.  (it was merged today so will be in the stats next week I expect)
* This week:
   * Wondering what I missed!
   * My focus will be learning & extending the “PIO” functionality on the rp2
   * Already blogged a couple of Learn-related items
   * Made my own version of the bugfix for rp2040 neopixel problem, we’ll see which one is worth incorporating
A friend reports that they couldn’t install esptool on an “M1” mac, something to do with the “crypto” library.  If you know something about this, let me know in the text chat.  It would be good to get an issue filed somewhere about it.


56:44 @jerryn
* Last week        
   * Continued exploring rp2040 -- an issue with neopixels emerged and appears ot be close to resolution
   * Stumbled across an issue with native busdevice which si7021 driver -- It used a previously untested function. Mark fixed the issue and it has  has been merged.
   * Issues with the BrainCraft Hat and new RPi kernels have gotten worse - now it won’t compile.  Following open issue.
   * Set up my MagTag to capture data on my solar panels then forward data to AIO
      * Baked on showand tell https://www.heatherclassen.com/solar-panel-tracker-with-adafruit-magtag/

## 59:13 In The Weeds


59:59 @jepler - I’d like to prepare a document for meeting participants “how to participate in the CircuitPython weekly meeting”, and trim some of the introductory verbiage from the meeting proper to save just a bit of time.  It’s also a chance to standardize how to specify speaking vs just lurking; I prefer to ask everyone speaking to make sure their placeholder is in the notes doc but the “traditional” way is to ask everyone lurking to make sure their placeholder is in the notes doc.  I think making things “more passive” for lurkers is a positive.
* Resolution: @jepler will write it up as a pr into the meeting github repo
* Update Running Meeting doc to have “pre intro” that we don’t record, and “intro” we record.


1:06:06 @deshipu — can we have a kind of shim Python library frozen by default in all the “game” CircuitPython boards, that would give us a standardized and consistent way to access the buttons, the display, and the speaker? I’m thinking bout something like ugame.py for the Stage library, or the  https://github.com/deshipu/circuitpython-vacuum-invaders-displayio/blob/master/controls.py — I don’t want people to have to edit sources to change the pin names to be able to play my games on different devices, and I also don’t want to have to include ten bazillion files for in every game for every possible device.


1:15:27 @jerryn -- follow-up on issue with Pico and neopixels


1:24:26 @mark - how can we initializing more than 5 pins with StateMachine on the RP2040


1:26:18 @jfurcean (lurking) - add RPi Pico busio.I2C(), busio.SPI() PR #4157.  I would be interested in hearing a discussion on this. https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/4157#issue comment-775289189 


1:48:03 @tannewt - Do we want to have a manual test folder? I think we have testing scripts that we could share.
