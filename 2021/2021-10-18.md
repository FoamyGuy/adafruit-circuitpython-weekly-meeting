## 20:29 Status Updates


20:54 @jepler
* Last week:
   * OV5640 camera work
   * MicroPython 1.17 merge. No big new features were introduced, because we already had a version of f-strings.
   * Added IncrementalEncoder “divisor” property, good for non-Adafruit encoders that give fewer pulses per detent (or have no detents)
* This week:
   * Looking into implementing the watchdog timer for SAMD51.




22:34 @CGrover (text only)
* Last week:
   * Wrapped up the PyPortal dual load cell scale project with a custom NAU7802 ADC FeatherWing. Learned a bunch about Python object-orientation when abstracting screens, touch buttons, and devices into classes. Whew.   (demo: https://youtu.be/kA_hozwNnLg)
* This week:
   * Setting the coding fun aside for a while to redesign two PCBs to accommodate parts shortages. Hopefully the new designs will last for a while.
   * Will take a shot at refining the scale’s round Dial class to behave like a dial and 90-degree meter display widget.
   * With the cooler weather, it’s time to put on the fiberglass hazmat suit for entering the attic to upgrade and rewire the ancient doorbell system. I know there’s a 1940s-era 8VAC 10VA transformer up there somewhere.


23:39 @danh
* Testing boot keyboard: doesn’t work on Mac, does work on an old PC BIOS. We will leave the Mac problem alone now.
* Fixing PDMIn problem in 7.0.0. Fixed, but getting different results than previously. Out of range values at beginning of sample.
* Automating Windows 7/8.1 driver generation.
* WIll be working more intently on asyncio or similar support for CircuitPython 8.0.0.


25:47 @foamyguy
* Reviewing type info PRs
* Working on “Pie Chart Chomper” a pacman style game for Pico + LCD addon, may eventually create differently sized sprite assets and port to PyGamer or other devices.


26:24 @kattni
* Last week:
   * PrettyPins Metro Mini (first in its chipset)
   * Started ATtiny817 breakout guide
      * Guide core is done.
      * CircuitPython section is mostly complete - needs a bit more copy, and GIFs.
      * Barely started Arduino section.
   * Trying to understand the ATtiny817 breakout, seesaw, EEPROM, etc.
* This week:
   * Work with Melissa to provide feedback to the PyPI folks on our usage and feature requests
   * Continue ATtiny817 breakout guide
      * Finish CircuitPython section
      * Finish Arduino section
   * Update the Welcome to CircuitPython guide - Will discuss this further In the Weeds.


28:15 @MakerMelissa
* Last Week:
   * Worked on CircuitPython Code editor File GUI
   * Fixed a bug in the File Transfer Library write function
* This Week:
   * Finish up working on the Code Editor File stuff
   * Work on compatibility with mobile devices
   * Start writing a guide on usage


28:49 @tannewt
* Was working on getting USB going on the RPi but hit a bit of a wall. Will poke it later this week.
* In the meantime I’ve started getting CP going over UART. Can do math in the REPL but object pointers are getting messed up so other things crash.
* After that I’ll be looking at enabling displayio over HDMI
* May take a bit of time to fix bugs for Hacktoberfest.
## 30:27 In The Weeds


@kattni - Updating the Welcome to CircuitPython guide.


@danh’s original notes on the Guide:


* Welcome To CircuitPython
   * great as is; the photo is a bit long in the tooth now
* a missing topic: "How do I Learn Python?"
   * We are agnostic about this, but I think we should provide some pointers, perhaps to pages at Python.org, some books, online courses, etc. This question comes up frequently.
* Frequently Asked Questions
   * maybe move this section down to above Troubleshooting? The first subsection about old library bundles is duplicative of something in Troubleshooting.
* Installing CircuitPython
   * mention RPI-RP2 in the list of BOOT drive names
* The CIRCUITPY Drive
   *  The "renaming the drive" section could be put on its own page and moved further down, since it takes a lot of space and is not that relevant to beginners.
* Connecting to the Serial Console
* Interacting with the Serial Console
   * Group these with the other Serial Console pages? See below.
* CircuitPython Hardware
   * This is old and describes only some M0 boards. We could delete this, or make a separate guide. There is this page, but it's also out of date: https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-choose-a-microcontroller/circuitpython-boards
* Advanced Serial Console on Windows
* Advanced Serial Console on Mac and Linux
   * Perhaps these could be grouped with the other Serial pages and some or all put under an expandable heading to reduce the size of the left sidebar
* PyCharm and CircuitPython
   * Move this under "Creating and Editing Code"?
* CircuitPython for ESP8266
   * I think we can remove this completely.
* Troubleshooting
   * Include RP2040 "flash_nuke.uf2" info
* a missing page: "CircuitPython Documentation"
   * Point to readthedocs for CircuitPython and the libraries, and explain that it's for reference. I have helped several people who were unaware of readthedocs, and this would help.
