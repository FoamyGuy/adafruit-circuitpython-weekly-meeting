## 17:00 Status Updates


17:50 @danh
* Minor work on asyncio (mostly library bundling issues).
* Back to work trying to knock off bugs for 7.1.0 final.


18:53 @CGrover (text only)
* Conducted a marathon session to wrap up the Scale project v2.0-Alpha. Significant progress improving operational performance and memory usage with a robust UI. https://github.com/CedarGroveStudios/Scale
* Scale v2.0-Alpha code size increased 21% but free memory increased from 22kB to 68kB. Woo hoo!
*   * Scale’s graphics and touchscreen zones are display size independent. Built-in board size is automatically detected; user-specified for other displays. Font sizes are based upon display size, but do not scale proportionally. Tare and alarm settings are stored on the SD card and used upon power-up. To facilitate testing, the code will simulate a missing custom loadcell FeatherWing board (important during the chip shortage).
* Revised the Scale’s custom FeatherWing PCB design to accommodate a less-desirable but available chip package. DIP-16 chips are huge!
* Next:
   * Take a break from retro widget development to make a MatrixPortal snowman decoration with random blizzard and global warming modes.
   * Place that ever-growing OSH Park and stencil order.
   * Resume retro widget development once I play in the sandbox enough to understand how extending a super class works.


20:35 @david.glaude (lurking)
   * CP things
   * Tested Wi-Fi Monitor Mode with Feather S2
   * Added booster progress bar on my copy of the “MagTag COVID Vaccination Percent Tracker” https://twitter.com/DavidGlaude/status/1466170477592952834?s=20
   * Non CP things:
   * Added booster in my blood for better protection
   * A lot of tasmota failure trying to use an ESP8266 in a IKEA Vindriktning Air Quality Sensor (PM1006 sensor)


21:17 @foamyguy
Last week:
   * Dig out some Arduino devices and learn enough to be able to test a PR to the AVR_Prog library
   * Work on a fix for RP2040 NVM writing
   * PR to pybadger library to support PyBadge LC hardware variant.
   * Write out a list of core modules that I’d like to get examples created for
This week:
   * Try to build board.pyi file with all available pins
   * Look into and try out the work recently done on cooperative multi-tasking
   * Start porting some existing games for the pimoroni picosystem


23:30 @jepler
   * Tested but failed to reproduce some reported problems with SD cards & AirLift sharing an SPI bus
   * Put in some PRs for ESP32S3 including support for 3 boards
   * This week is a short week, will verify some camera functionality & build a small demo for internal use
   * Missing next Monday meeting


24:22 @jerryn
   * Experimented with the broadcom port  
   * Raspberry pi zero 2w working as expected
   * Cannot get Raspberry Pi 4B to boot
   * Got openocd connected but not learning much… yet
   * Some questions “in the weeds”
   * Submitted PRs to RFM9x and RFM69 to replace time.monotonic() with supervisor.ticks_ms()  per a forum request.  In review.
   * Raspberry Pi has added “legacy” support for the camera to Bullseye
   * https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/new-old-functionality-with-raspberry-pi-os-legacy/
   * Some old projects are now working
   * Braincraft hat now works, but tensorflow-lite does not -- likely needs an updated version.
   * Tried to make sense of an issue with SDCards (sdcardio vs adafruit_sdcard)
   * Ended up more confused than ever, but all working now with latest CP
   * There is still an unresolved issue that a forum user is having, but I cannot reproduce it.


27:00 @kattni
   * Last week
   * Updated Adafruit Community Code of Conduct with a couple of new things
   * Published Feather ESP32-S2 guide
   * Some Arduino ESP32-S2 BSP updates
   * Learned what BSP stands for
   * Taught Anne how to use the Adafruit Learn System Templates
   * Published the core of the KB2040 guide (still needs CP Essentials)
   * Wrote ESP32-S2 and RP2040 “Factory Reset” templates to put into board guides
   * Updated the CircuitPython pins.c for KB2040 so silk pins come first when there are multiple names for the same pin
   * So far today:
   * Fixed the Itsy RP2040 pinouts page - one of the pin details was incorrect
   * Merge a couple of PRs
   * Continue KB2040 guide
   * This week:
   * Finish KB2040 guide

31:10 @makermelissa
   * Last week:
   * Finished writing guide for Nunchuck Laser Cat Toy, which is currently in moderation.
   * Added some missing boards to circuitpython.org
   * Tested out Micro:bit V2 on CircuitPython Code Editor on several platforms. Was unable to get it working on Windows.
   * Started looking into an error with the WebSerial ESPTool and found a reliable way to easily reproduce the error.
   * This week:
   * Working on the WebSerial ESPTool error
   * Add new Blinka boards to circuitpython.org
   * Probably some guide updates after


32:00 @Mark(gamblor) [lurking]
   * Got a IS31 function based on PixelBuf working (similar to Neopixel)
   * Really dove into the core and native class subclassing. If anyone has any questions Foamyguy and I discussed it a bit in a thread on discord or feel free to ask me.
   * Need to determine where to place any python libraries related to IS31
   * Need to PR the core work I did still


33:00 @tannewt (out)
   * Last week:
   * Added pin mux info into broadcom-peripherals.
   * Added pin in use checking and resetting
   * Added support for all I2C peripherals.
   * Over the weekend I figured out my desktop power supply was failing and causing my wakeup issue. (And maybe other things.)
   * This week I'm:
   * Finishing the CircuitPython on Raspberry Pi learn guide. (started during my stream.)
   * Finishing full UART support.
   * Covid booster shot on Tuesday afternoon so may be slow Tuesday after and Wednesday.
   * Last stream of the year on Friday. Back Jan 7th tentatively.


## In The Weeds
33:51 @jerryn
   * Since Scott is out, we can defer this if no one else can address it.
   * Curious if anyone has gotten a Raspberry Pi 4B to boot to the REPL?
   * [Scott suggests disabling CIRCUITPY_USB_MSC and try again]
   * Sanity check -- zero2w uses raspberrypi_pi3.cfg and 4B uses raspberrypi_pi4.cfg for openocd, correct?
   * My installation of aarch64-none-eabi-gdb apparently was built with Python 2 :-(
   * Had to install python2-dev to run gdb.
   * Are others finding this -- do I have to build it locally to get Python3?
   * How do you use the .py scripts in “peripherals”? 


42:45 @Mark (Gamblor) (I should be here for this)
   * Where to put IS31FL3741 python libraries for interfacing with the core and not causing confusion with the existing libraries


46:50 @kattni
   * Discuss the dates for the next four meetings - 13 December 2021, 20 December 2021, 27 December 2021, 3 January 2022.
## 48:20 Wrap-Up
