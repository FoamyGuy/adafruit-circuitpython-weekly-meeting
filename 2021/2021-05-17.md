### 3:00 Upstream MicroPython Versions Merged Into CircuitPython
"Adafruit has recently incorporated updates from MicroPython: 1.9.4ish through six releases to the latest, 1.15. It is nearly three years of changes to MicroPython. This brings the Python core used in CircuitPython very close to the one in MicroPython. It'll make it easier to collaborate on the core going forward. MicroPython's new release policy of one every two months or so should make it easier for CircuitPython to keep up to date. We don't share much port-specific code but we're excited to be able to collaborate on the core Python VM going forwards."

"Our community has expressed interest in more advanced features of upstream MicroPython such as native modules. This merge will make it easier to bring those advancements to CircuitPython."

CircuitPython 7 - New Core Language Features from MicroPython

* Assignment expressions, sometimes called the "walrus operator":

if (m := rx.match(line)): print(m.group(0))

* Variable type annotations:

class Foo: x: int = 1

* Matrix multiplication operator (however this is not yet supported by ulab, see https://github.com/v923z/micropython-ulab/issues/277):

### 4:27 PyCon US 2021

PyCon US, the official annual Python gathering, was May 12-15, 2021. The event was entirely virtual and content is currently available for registered participants. The event talks will be released on the PyCon US YouTube channel approximately a week after the event - https://us.pycon.org/2021/

Kattni is hosting CircuitPython Development Sprints on May 17-18, 2021. Be aware that this year is a little different with it being virtual. Stop by the [PyConUS Sprints 2021 Discord](https://discord.gg/X9D5V5Z9kY)

## 26:58 Status Updates
@anecdata (lurking)


@cgrover (just listening)


30:48 @danh
   * Working toward a 6.3.0 release. I cherry picked a few key fixes and many new boards and board corrections. Also updated frozen libraries. Because of the number of changes, I’ll do a release candidate first.
   * Supporting early users of dynamic USB. Found an ES32-S2 safe mode issue with @Neradoc.
   * Working on boot HID device support. Finished writing most of the code. The number of separate HID interfaces needs to be limited because certain tables are statically allocated.
   * Upcoming work:
   * Learn Guide for dynamic USB next before finishing HID boot devices.
   * Debug RP2040 boards failing to come up reliably on power-on. Multiple resets are sometimes required.
   * Finish 6.3.0 release.
   * Work on a native key-matrix scanner module.
   * Work on a 7.0.0 alpha release.
   * Continue to hunt bugs in 7.0.0.

45:14 @krayola (Rose)
   * Last week (and earlier):
   * Started on a CircuitPython project to control my HDMI Matrix over serial and to control USB switching between computers. Progress has been slow, but I have all the parts I need now, I think.  But I think I need to print a bigger enclosure.
   * Made a mouse jiggler with a Neo Trinkey to keep my work computer awake when my personal machine has the keyboard and mouse switched to it.
   * Got my first Pfizer shot on Friday, two weeks before my provincial booking system slot.
   * This week:
   * I’m participating in the first day of the CircuitPython sprints. Kattni has a number of issues in mind for me already!
   * Managed to make a rotating python logo on the 64x64 led matrix with a Matrix Portal!  I even documented what I did to create the logo sprite in a Jupyter notebook.
   * 3d printed a diffuser for it from transparent grey, but it could use work.



47:03 @MakerMelissa
* Last Week:
  * Finished up a FunHouse Home Assistant Water Sensor guide
  * Worked on an issue with nRFUtil that was causing issues with Learn guide PRs to fail.
  * Tested out the SSD1680 Monochrome eInk displays with the driver
  * Tweaked some guide code to work with it
  * Updated FunHouse Capacitive Touchpad code to work a bit better
* This week:
  * Testing out an issue with Raspberry Pi installer scripts
  * Do a sweep of any new boards for CircuitPython.org
  * Work on a new guide for running Blinka on the Raspberry Pi Pico with MicroPython


27:27 @tannewt
* 1.14 and 1.15 are merged in. MicroPython merge is done.
* Chatted with Damien and Jim and want to work towards no changes in the `py` directory.
* Status LED change PR is getting close. Debugged SAMD issues at the end of the week. Need to investigate M4 CAN board.
* Chatted with Trevor and Antonio about the app side of BLE workflow. My goal is to start the CP side of it this week.
* Getting my second Pfizer shot Monday afternoon so I may be less active at the start of the week depending on how it hits me.

28:40 @TG-Techie
* Last Week(s):
  * Made a rev04 watch board which is currently in testing and validation phase
  * Got an order for a watch!
  * Started making Tech TikToks (handle: tg.techie)
  * Got 2nd PFizer dose yesterday right as the college semester ended
* Next Week:
  * Add BT software support to the TG-Watch for auto time setting and phone loss notification
  * Start altering the TG-Gui-Std library so it is easier to make it cross platform (like the 5th version was). It will build on top of QT for desktop and (ofc) Displayio for CircuitPython.

@jerryn
48:41 How do you actually use Blinka on MicroPython boards? What has to be copied over? Just looking for basic startup steps.
* [Basic Steps](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Blinka/issues/445#issuecomment-833923511)
50:04 Which boards are now supported?
* PyBoard and Raspberry Pi Pico
51:19 Would it be possible to add “Blinka” as a searchable keyword for the main guide to installing Blinka?
* Which is +the main guide?
* https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-raspberrypi-linux
* I always think it should come up.
* That one’s for 40-pin Raspberry Pis and yes we can.
* I’m going to work on a guide for setting it up on the Pico and can add it to that.

52:46 @kattni - LED animations
* Split animations to a core and complex animations library
