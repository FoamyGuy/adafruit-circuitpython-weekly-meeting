### 4:47 More Coverage of Using CircuitPython Drivers on MicroPython on the Raspberry Pi Pico

More coverage of the headline in [the last newsletter](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/2021/05/18/python-on-microcontrollers-newsletter-faster-python-circuitpython-merges-and-more-python-adafruit-circuitpython-micropython-thepsf/) on using CircuitPython drivers on MicroPython on the Raspberry Pi Pico:

### 5:34 Disable CircuitPython USB devices in boot.py

With the upcoming #CircuitPython  7.x, you'll be able to selectively disable the many USB devices it creates (e.g. CIRCUITPY drive & USB serial).

### 6:06 Adafruit Squeezes the Power of the RP2040 Into a USB key

On the Desk of Ladyada, Limor discusses development of the Adafruit Trinkey RP2040 with QT connector - [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIhUpL8eyQI).

> We've wanted to have something that plugs into a USB A port and provides a QT port for a while. But since we want it to support any and all QT boards, we need more RAM and storage than the SAMD21 can provide. We probably cannot buy any SAMD51's for like a year - but RP2040 is a good option! Lots of RAM and we stuck an 8MB flash on there. The idea is you can attach a QT sensor or whatever on top with some nylon standoffs, maybe it will even auto-detect which sensors are plugged in! We made the boot button a user-button too, thanks to a li'l diode friend.

### 7:14 Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect Now Runs CircuitPython

Liz ([@BlitzCityDIY](https://twitter.com/BlitzCityDIY)) submitted a PR to add support for the Arduino Nano RP2040 to CircuitPython! So far so good, the digital pins all toggle right and see the built in LSM6DSOX chip on the I2C port. There is a driver for this IMU so the video has quick demo: an external OLED wired up on the same I2C bus, reading acceleration/gyro data and displaying it - [YouTube](https://youtu.be/ppFYk1YdDjo)

### 7:51 PSF: Second Quarter 2021 Fundraiser

PyLadies Brazil co-founder, Débora Azevedo, can capture her feelings about our Python community in one word: Belonging - [Python.org](https://mailchi.mp/python.org/you-made-it-possible?e=9b20e3624a).

Débora stumbled upon her love for programming accidentally. “I pursued a computer networking course because I didn’t want to code,” she said. “But when I learned Python, I had this empowered feeling that I could really build something.”

Thanks to community support, the PSF has provided more than 651 PyCon scholarships and travel grants to community members, like Débora, and $2,804,281 in grants to Python projects across 91 countries, over the past twenty years.

You made this possible. You built this incredible community and sustained it for more than twenty years. You helped us come this far.

To continue this growth, The Python Software Foundation needs your help raising $80,000 by June 12th. Giving: [Python Software Foundation](https://psfmember.org/civicrm/contribute/transact?reset=1&id=33)

### 9:00 The 2021 Python Language Summit: Lightning Talks, Round 1

The first day of the 2021 Python Language Summit finished with a series of lightning talks from Petr Viktorin, Lorena Mesa, Scott Shawcroft, and Jeff Allen.

CircuitPython is a much smaller version of Python that runs on microcontrollers. Scott Shawcroft compared what's included in CircuitPython and CPython to give a sense of what is central to users' experience of Python.

28:27 @tannewt
* Heads down on BLE Workflow hopefully.

* Deep Dive will be on Thursday!

@anecdata (lurking)


29:28 @CGrover
* After adding a configurable pseudocolor spectrum helper, tuned and updated the 2x interpolated AMG8833 thermal camera code. Tested the latest version on 7 different development boards, some with integral displays, some without. Since the thermal camera has a mix of I2C and SPI connections, a number-crunching ulab method, as well as a memory-hungry implementation of very dynamically changing displayio elements (over 240), it appears to nicely stress the host development board. Found that the PyBadge/Gamer performed the best for the camera application. The RP2040 and ESP32-S2 FeatherS2 were surprisingly much slower and were unable to achieve the target rate of 2 frame/sec. Will share a comparison graph during the in-the-weeds section Performance_Comparison
* Next week: 
   * Will assess the level of effort to update the existing Thermal Camera learning guide with the new code. 
   * Try 3x and 4x interpolation techniques with the thermal camera’s displayio Rect approach before moving to @David.G’s tried-and-true bitmap scheme. Hope to get to testing vectorio, as well.
   * Find some affordable high-quality servos for the robotic cuckoo clock. After about 6 months of operation, the internal bird gets a weird case of laryngitis. 


32:38 @danh
* Debugging startup problems on random RP2040 boards. The issue is that the crystal oscillator is starting up too slowly.
* Verified that @neradoc’s fixes to adafruit-board-toolkit work on an M1 Mac. PR submitted and accepted to mu beta to include the changes.
* Starting to work on a general keyboard matrix library.
* Will get out 6.3.0-rc.0 today or tomorrow 
* Will get a 7.0.0-alpha release out soon (won’t step on 6.3.0-rc.0).


35:12 @david.glaude (text)
* No project done last week.


35:25 @dherrada
* Last week
   * Running 3 adabot patches (>1000 commits total)
   * Finishing up FunHouse IOT hub guide (just waiting on some learn repo failures to be resolved)
* This week
   * Code for 3 guides, writing one
   * CircuitPython libraries to main (may be next week)
   * Making my own usb cables


36:00 @foamyguy
* Last week
   * PR in cookiecutter for better handling when user inputs a library name with spaces in it.
   * Spent the majority of project time learning about adafruit.io, figuring out how to upload images to it, and show them on a dashboard. Also learning about MQTT (first time using it) how to subscribe to feeds with CircuitPython and receive callbacks when new data is available.
   * Put this knowledge to use by integrating designio with Adafruit.io webhooks. This allows users to automatically upload designs to adafruit.io when they’re saved. The accompanying “receiver” code can run on a FunHouse and will download the newest version of the design whenever it gets updated
* This week
   * Deploy designio to a public facing server
   * Get back into the circuitpython org repos


37:50 @hierophect (missing)
* Last week: 
   * Reviews and Alarm merges
   * Debugging PinAlarm on the RP2040
* This week
   * Wrap up RP2040 Alarm
   * Clean up NRF Alarm
   * Work on next file


38:09 @jeff e (missing meeting)
* Last week: vacation
* This week: back on Tuesday. Debugging crashes with wifi+rgbmatrix on esp32s2, probably


38:24 @jerryn
* Last week.
   * Helped with testing of a PR for the TCA9548a -- good learning experience
      * Had one in a drawer for years -- nice to actually use it
   * Set up soil moisture sensors for the garden - uses umfeathers2 to send data via MQTT to Home Assistant.  With deep sleep hoping for decent battery life. Off to a good start. Home Assistant has been working very well.
   * Tried out Blinka on Pico with Micropython -- I2c example working ok.
      * Treid ESP8266 but it runs out of memory -- not sure if it’s worth much effort. Really would like to use an esp32 but it is not supported …. yet
   * It would be nice to use the rfm boards with an esp32 and I completely forgot that at some point last year I had helped with porting the rfm9x/69 libraries to work with Micropython! It actually works!. I don’t recall what if any issues remained  but it seems to be functional. https://github.com/nohcpy/MicroPython_RFM9x https://github.com/nohcpy/MicroPython_RFM69
   * Spent more time looking into the rotary encoder issue where it can lose counts.
      * Confirmed that it occurs in Arduino and CP suggesting it is in  the Seesaw implementation. Really has to be since the libraries just read the data.
* This week
   * Plan to pick up working on Micropython version of rfm libraries and put to use with ESP32 boards

48:44 @Jose David (missing meeting)
* Will need some help understanding why we have problems with the RP2040, and not other boards https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_TCA9548A/pull/32


53:52 @CGrover
* Sharing thermal camera development board performance comparison. Curious about I2C and SPI performance of the RP2040 Feather and the FeatherS2 boards.

1:04:34 @Mark(Gamblor)
* Using DMA with SPI for the ESP32S2 display transfer causes display glitches at higher frequencies (> ~5Mhz). Looking for any thoughts on why? I’ve gone through all the ESP32S2 library code and examples and haven’t seen any reasons why.

* Soliciting input on a keypad matrix library.
