Overall: The big thing is that we’re firmly in 7.0 work land on the main branch.  Be aware that things are changing a lot.  I started to merge Micropython updates in which will cause turmoil but we’d love people to use it if they feel brave.  If you find issues and can help fix them we’d appreciate that too. It’ll put us in a better place for 7.0, but it will have a bit of instability in the short term.

Overall: I’m happy to see the flurry of documentation updates and improvements happening - early hug report to @jose david for picking that up. I’m also super excited to say the oldest library PR we have has been tested successfully and is essentially ready to be merged!! We’re looking at updating the CI on the libraries to include more information when Pylint/Black etc fail, so folks know what to do instead of either us telling them or them figuring it out themselves. That should streamline PRs quite a bit. Note: GitHub made it so first time contributors require someone to “approve” the CI to begin running - so it’s really important to keep up with new PRs so that new folks have a positive experience!

29:18 @tannewt
* Merging in MicroPython
* 1.10 is in.
* 1.11 is in draft PR but failing CI
* 1.12 is in progress. Merged but not compiling.
* 1.13, 1.14, 1.15 are all unstarted.
* Getting my first dose of the vaccine tonight!
* After merging I need to circle back to status LED changes and then BLE workflow.


@v923z lurking



31:16 @anecdata (lurking)
* Working on AP mode for ESP32-S2. PR #4650. Feel free to comment and test.


31:29 @CGrover (text only)
* Revisited two projects, the dual espresso scale (load cells + lots of displayio) and the Thermal Camera. 
   * Added audible scale zones/thresholds for hands-off use as well as touch screen controls for initial setup, zeroing, tare recording, etc. It’s working for now, but ideally would like to create touch buttons without fills or outlines so that they don’t interfere with background graphics; may require a PR.
   * The Thermal Camera received new pseudo color spectrums to replace the more limiting color palette -based approach. Developed some 1-dimensional interpolation methods in CircuitPython. The one based upon the heat signature of heated iron is working the best and looks the most like existing commercial imagers.
* Experienced an overheating issue with a PyPortal installed in an enclosure. Determined that the TFT backlight generated the majority of the heat. The backlight and a tiny fan are now controlled by an algorithm that monitors ambient light and PCB temperature. Problem solved.
* The next quest is to learn enough about 2-dimensional interpolation to implement something in CircuitPython for testing.
* Unrelated: The book illustration project was bitten by the scope creep monster. Instead of 12 drawings, we’ll need about 44. Pretty daunting for this fledgling artist, but I’m still having fun. They’ll just need to be patient with my sloooowwww pace.


@charlesburnaford (lurking)


33:04 @danh
* Finishing up initial coding of dynamic USB descriptors. Now getting the compilation bugs out. Will start on testing and debugging in earnest very soon.
* Worrying about some 6.2.0 regressions.


34:28 @David.Glaude (lurking)
* CP: Nothing or almost nothing (that seems to be since two or three weeks in a row).
* Non CP:
   * Restored a set of Wireless Buzz! controler (leaked battery)
   * Adapted my working code for wired Buzz! controler (python on Raspberry Pi)


34:54 @foamyguy
* Last week
   * Merged the progress bar PR and update learn guides to reflect the new changes
   * Began work on a HTML/JS requirement screenshot maker for learn guides. This spawned the idea to try to make this more automated and integrated with CI.
   * Tested the changes from LED PWM controller PR TLC59711.
   * Discovered small issue with PortalBase pin initialization (fix merged)
   * Discovered potential issue with the project bundler not finding required libraries in some cases. (weeds topic)
* This week
   * Continue working on the requirement screenshot utility. Need to work out how to correctly detect the use of secrets.py, font/, images/ or other things used by individual projects that should be included in the screenshots. I am interested in learning how the project bundler is working, perhaps some of it can be reused for this.
   * Work on readthedocs and PyPi releases for the repos in the circuitpython org, and breaking out more of the widgets into new repos.


38:15 @hierophect
* Last week:
   * Merges and maintenance of the NRF52 alarm system
   * Installed pre-commit for formatting cleanup
   * Caught the STM32 alarm stuff up to recent changes
   * Implemented most of the RP2040 alarm module, just wrestling with deep sleep stuff still
* This week
   * Merge and maintain the ever-growing list of alarm PRs, hopefully starting with NRF52
   * Wrap up the RP2040 alarm system
   * Whatever’s next


39:31 @Hugo
* Last week
   * Some work on updating the CP branding during build (not as much as anticipated)
   * [Github] Discussion about CookieCutter and default branch naming ([Issue #124](https://github.com/adafruit/cookiecutter-adafruit-circuitpython/issues/124))
   * Got 2nd shot - a bit rougher than the first, but still beats full-on CoVid-19 infection/symptoms
* This week
   * Work on CP branding
      * Investigate if using a templating library (Django, Jinja2) for text replacement would be simple and worthwhile
      * Templating library or not, perform actual text-replacement

40:50 @jepler
* Last week:
   * Very focused on this camera project
* This week:
   * Releasing the adafruit_ov7670 library & adding to bundle
   * Investigating possible “posterization” of camera data on the rp2040, seen by Limor.
   * Learning about OpenMV and how we might adapt it or reimplement it in CircuitPython.  Keeping in mind that I know nothing about machine vision & AI

51:30 @Jose David
* We are seeing differences in the way Sphinx docs are being built both by the CI and locally. Is there any difference in the configuration that we are not seeing?

https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_DisplayIO_Layout/issues/34#issuecomment-825064756
* 55:08 Could we combine some issues in the DHT library? In one more general?
* 57:18 What is our policy in `won't fix` for old issues. Or others difficult to test/support




1:00:46 @foamyguy
* Project bundler seems to miss imports that are not “top level” at the top of the file. The instance I found was with this guide: https://learn.adafruit.com/electronic-history-of-the-day-with-pyportal the bundle does not include adafruit_miniqr which I think it would need in order to draw a QR on the screen. Inside PortalBase it only imports miniqr when the user calls the function to use it. So I think it’s getting missed by the findimports utility.
* I’m interested in learning how the project bundler works to figure out which files should be included in the bundle. I think we might be able to reuse some of it for making accurate screenshots for the project. Answer: JSON is generated from https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython-build-tools 
* @makermelissa: These are added to requirements.txt I submitted a PR for miniqr to be added to PortalBase.


1:03:42 @tannewt
* Checked with Phil and Limor and got the greenlight to move the repos @askpatrickw mentioned last week. Who wants to help move those and make sure everything gets updated?


1:05:44 @v923z 
* Is there interest in a float-only implementation of ulab? The benefit is significant reductions in the firmware size.
