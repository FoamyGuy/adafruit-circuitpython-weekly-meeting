* Fun
   * Created an alarm so I know when my dog wants to go out -- she just stands by the door…
      * Uses VL53l0X with a TinyPico (MicroPython) to detect proximity to the door - then sends message via MQTT to my RPi HomeAssistant which sends a notification to my phone… it works great! Very handy when I am in my office.

41:33 @tannewt
* Getting caught up. You all are doing a ton of great stuff!
* Created cascadetoml for cascading TOML config: https://github.com/adafruit/cascadetoml
* TOML “database” of flash config is here: https://github.com/adafruit/nvm.toml
* Next step is to tie that config into the CP build to generate the RP2040 stage2 for a given flash (or flashes).
* Converted the assembly stage2 code to C to make it easier to maintain: https://github.com/tannewt/circuitpython/blob/rp2040_flash/ports/raspberrypi/stage2.c

@anecdata (lurking)


43:59 @CGrover (text only):
* Continuing on the brushed DC motor quest:
   * Working on an update to the CircuitPython_Motor.motor library to allow selecting the decay mode of most modern motor controller chips and boards. The default “coasting” decay mode doesn’t take full advantage of the more effective “braking” decay mode available in newer controller chips. Using braking mode establishes a directly proportional relationship between throttle and motor RPM; very handy for controlling robot velocity and calculating distance traveled. When coupled with a lower PWM frequency, motor spin threshold and low-speed torque are dramatically enhanced, as well.
   * Will need some advice on what UI will work best for the motor library decay_mode getter/setter -- or perhaps just changing the default mode to braking. Submitted an issue in advance of the PR to facilitate the discussion.
   * Plans are to re-run tests for the menagerie of brushed DC motors in the workshop inventory to compare mode differences, submit the associated PR, and rewrite the previous learning guide. Hope to receive a shipment of all (available) Adafruit motor controller chips and boards and N20-style motors this week to verify the tests.
* Unrelated-ish: Work on the illustrations for the book of poetry continues. My drawing skills are improving, thank goodness. Still not certain what the author saw in my primitive doodles.


45:30 @danh
* Fixed RP2040 busio.I2C. It now does bitbang for short writes. Works on most but not all I2C devices.
* Fixed a last-minute Group bug.
* Released CircuitPython 6.2.0-beta.3.
* Fixed Tilegrid transpose problem.
* Did yet more build shrinking.
* Lots of reviews.
* Accidental release of beta.4 before its time. Undid that, and am now keep draft release notes in an issue instead of in a release draft.
* Got feedback from RPi folks on short I2C writes on RP2040.
* Zeroing in on ESP32-S2 I2C vs. wifi issues.


49:13 @David.Glaude (lurking)

@Jayguitar (lurking)

## 53:01 In The Weeds


53:17 @dglaude (will likely find a microphone)
* IS31FL3731 refactoring
   * Changes already manually merged in as part of a new PR #38 so this can be skipped


Six month ago I made a PR (answering an issue) for that library to split it into a module to save space. Because that mean (identified) work in learn guide it was never done and left as a ready to apply PR. With the Pico and Pimoroni embracing CircuitPython for some of their product, a PR from Sandy Macdonald (ex-@Pimoroni) was accepted, breaking my PR, and another PR from Sandy is in the pipeline to fix the initial commit.
Now another PR is in the pipeline from Michael Horne (from blog https://www.recantha.co.uk/blog/).
And yet another contribution is maybe coming (see https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_IS31FL3731/issues/27).
Not counting me, there are 3 people in the Pimoroni environment that are interested in this library.


* Michael Horne first impression on adapting a CircuitPython library: https://www.recantha.co.uk/blog/?p=20904


Michael blog post is super complex and somehow believed:
1. That he needed a compiler or something to make a library for CircuitPython (to do the mpy file)
2. That for that he needed to install WSL on his Windows machine for that, following those instruction: https://forums.adafruit.com/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=166738 => I added a link to mpy-cross binary for windows to avoid this again.


If https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython-org/issues/53 is fixed, it would make mpy-cross more easy to find too. But in the first place, why did he believe he needed to do mpy file? Because this is what you get when you download a library?


The result is a blog post that make it look super complex where it should not be.


Other problem (not library related) encountered:
* Working from WSL
* Mu not wanting to talk to the Pico (but why?) he had to use putty


Now he will discover that he need to fight with Black and PyLint see https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_IS31FL3731/pull/37.


I believe if he would have come to discord, he would have received guidance directly, but how would he have known.


Except for fixing the above, I believe that a chat/interview with Michael from one of you could help a lot, this could result in a blog post that is much more simple and useful to many.


1:04:15 @jerryn - In recent guide to adding Airlift to Pico, it emphatically states that you MUST use VSYS to power the Airlift https://learn.adafruit.com/quickstart-rp2040-pico-with-wifi-and-circuitpython/circuitpython-wifi#pico-wiring-3084904-3. Does anyone know why it is not OK to use VBUS? Is this correct since the Spec on VSYS is 1.5-5.5V and for the Airlift  Vin should be 3.3-5V. I’ve been using VBUS for awhile. Is  there a reason not to?
* @danh - I think it’s because using VBUS can backpower your USB connection, possibly damaging a host computer. Yes, you can be careful, but one slip and you might fry your expensive computer. See https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/pico/pico-datasheet.pdf?page=19 for suggestions, and see the schematic in that datasheet.


1:06:54 @kattni How should we be running Pylint on files in the `/tests` directory for libraries? Or should we be running it the same as any library file?
* https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_datetime/pull/3/checks?check_run_id=2018096357
* Above is a massive Pylint failure, but much of it is “missing docstring” or “invalid name”. There are a number of what appear to be reasonable failures as well though.
* Conclusions:
   * File cookiecutter issue for running pylint on tests like examples except for invalid name.
   * Apply to cookiecutter.
   * Apply to libraries with tests directories individually.
   * Datetime is special.
## 1:13:56 Wrap-Up
The next meeting will be March 15th. The US switches to Daylight Saving Time (aka “summer time”) on March 14, so remember to double check the hour in your local time zone. The new time of the meeting is 2PM in **UTC-4**
