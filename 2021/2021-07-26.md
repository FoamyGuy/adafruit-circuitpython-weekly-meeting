 CircuitPython 7.0.0 Alpha 5 Released 

CircuitPython 7.0.0-alpha.5, has been released. It is relatively stable, but contains a number of issues still to be addressed for 7.0.0. The Python API’s it presents may change.
Notable additions to 7.0.0 since 6.3.0 include:
* Support for the CircuitPython development workflow over BLE.
* Camera support on ESP32S2.
* The keypad key-scanning module.
* Run-time customization of USB devices.
* Merging in of MicroPython fixes and enhancements as of MicroPython 1.16.
* _pixelbuf is now adafruit_pixelbuf.
* colorwheel() routine moved to rainbowio.
* supervisor.ticks_ms() to allow easier time-keeping.
* Simplifications to the RGB status LED codes.
* A clocking fix for a few samples of RP2040 boards.

 USB-to-MIDI converter 

A USB-to-MIDI converter! It uses an Adafruit Rotary Trinkey with a USB jack hot glued in place of the encoder. This is a really bad idea. But at least the code's in CircuitPython - Twitter Thread.
5:25
 PixelWing 

The added Stemma/Qwiic connector on the PixelWing means you can have more plug and play fun! We’re making a fun project using the Adafruit MPU 6050 and CircuitPython to show how you can use MPU data to alter the matrix output - Twitter.

 Trackball module 

Moving objects on a screen by using a BlackBerry trackball module with an Adafruit CLUE using CircuitPython - Twitter

Overall: We’ve begun working on updating all the libraries and examples to work with breaking changes made in either libraries or CircuitPython 7. Thanks to @foamyguy for all the effort there. We’re continuing to see new libraries in both the Adafruit and Community bundles, as well as continued updates to both. We’re still trying to get through all of the open PRs - as always, if you’re waiting on us for more than 2 business days, please ping someone directly.

* Group Hug


15:45 @tannewt
* @cdwilson for the STM32 MicroMod definition PR
* @evildave666jp for testing CP on the STM32
* @todbot, @bonnom, @ps_nithin, @zenith, @danh, @neradoc for figuring out the arduino rp2040 is a different flash chip than what they say


16:37 @danh
* @kattni for discussions re what to do about `gamepad`
* @tannewt for extensive discussion on ideas about debugging audio problems
* @foamyguy for removing uses of `gamepad` from various libraries
* @Neradoc for user support in discord and working on a number of issues

17:50 @david.glaude (not present)
* @jim_mussared for a guest appearance in previous deep dive.
* @Neradoc for discotool (and @tannewt for promoting it on stream).
* @Collin for the Through Hole SMD Components trick (all of Collin’s lab are great but that one trick is amazing)
* Ricardo Quesada for the Bluepad gamepad library, now added to the CircuitPython Community Bundle. So bring your Bluetooth joystick, you can play wireless if you sacrifice AirLift.
* @foamyguy, @kattni, @danh and others that work on the gamepad to keypad migration.


18:33 @foamyguy
* @kattni for working on grid based LED Animations shown off in the keyboard hackchat on Hackaday.io last week
* @kmatch for creating bitmaptools and rotozoom functionality a while back. I am working on an “Asteroids” type game and this function is very helpful
* @lesamouraipourpre for working on many PRs to remove unneeded max_size for displayio.Group and update OnDiskBitmap to use the newer pixel_shader API if available. Also for sharing a solution to a CI / Sphinx issue I came across over the weekend.
* To the many Learn Guide authors, while reviewing Learn code PRs I discovered so many neat projects that I hadn’t seen before.


19:43 @jepler
* @pt for the one on one chat before the mechanical keyboards hackchat
* Hackaday for inviting us to the hackchat, and to all participants.  It was fun!
* @v923z for sustained work on ulab. In the past weeks, working on some changes we requested
* @dylan for her help with getting the adafruit_ticks library squared away


20:42 @jerryn (missing meeting)
* Group hug


## 20:51 Status Updates




21:30 @kattni
* Last week:
   * Got @foamyguy spun up on the breaking changes effort
   * Updated CircuitPlayground library to use keypad instead of gamepad.
   * Updated the Welcome to CircuitPython guide to refer to `LED` instead of `D13` in a few places - still need to update screenshots and likely have still missed some references.
   * Finished the NeoKey Ortho Snap-Apart guide - in moderation
   * Removed use of keypad from CircuitPlayground library, removed the function that required it (`were_pressed`) entirely as it was not used anywhere and was the only reason `gamepad`/`keypad` was needed for the library.
* This week:
   * Added SCD4x to the bundle.
   * Added example to MacroPad library based on shipped demo
   * Fixed references to D13 in CP Essentials guide in response to PR updating code examples.
   * Look at LED Animation PR
   * Write up a guide / guide page on using the MacroPad library


24:25 @makermelissa
* Last Week:
   * Worked on WebSerial ESPTool to try and get it working with ESP32 at speeds greater than 115200. Unfortunately it’s still not quite working, though the code is improved.
   * Worked on some miscellaneous GitHub issues
* This Week:
   * Get changes to WebSerial ESPTool tested and merged in.
   * Work on adding keypad module to Blinka
   * Work on some more GitHub issues related to CP7
   * Possibly start a new guide


25:45 @tannewt
* Still working on PulseOut API changes.
* Have a couple other bugs after that.
* Added support for more than one status neopixel and enabled it on playground boards.
* Recording a RealPython episode this week.


26:54 @danh
* Released CircuitPython 7.0.0-alpha.5.
* Worked through multiple iterations of `gamepad` deprecation with @kattni and @foamyguy.
* Still working on audio issues. After a report by PhilB that there were also issues on non RP2040 ports, widened the net and created a more comprehensive set of tests.
* Need to change `usb_hid` API to get ready for 7.0.0-beta.
* A number of other 7.0.0 issues still assigned to me.


29:14 @david.glaude (not present)
* CP:
   * Testing discotool (Mu fail to work on my Windows, so I used notepad and discotool to start putty)
   * Testing Bluepad gamepad library on Metro M4 with Joycon(R)
* Non-CP:
   * Connected my Game Boy Advance to the internet to play Tetris with the Pico based Gamelink adapter from StackSmashing: https://stacksmashing.gumroad.com/l/gb-link
   * Tested Ringcordion playing accordion on a PC with a RingCon (Nintendo) from game Ring Fit Adventure.


29:51 @foamyguy
* Last week
   * Worked on updating PyBadger library to use the newer keypad module for when gamepad gets removed in a future release
   * Testing and reviewing many Learn Guide code PRs for displayio.Group and OnDiskBitmap API changes
   * Started working on an Asteroids type game for PyGamer and similar devices
* Next week
   * Dig into OnDiskBitmap related issue with the Turtle library
   * Implement ship movement geometry for Asteroids game
   * Finish up displayio related API change fixes and move onto the non-displayio related ones
   * Planning to stream on CircuitPython day, but unsure of time yet.


31:18 @jepler
* Last week:
   * Added some content to the learn system
   * Made some 3D printed parts for the 5x6 snap apart key matrix
   * Helped out with the doc moves in ulab
   * Published the adafruit_ticks library to the bundle and pypi; dylan took care of readthedocs for me when I forgot about it
   * Entered a PR to show the module availability on the individual module pages in addition to the support matrix page, may refine the words a bit
   * Tried out IO for images, but there’s a bug on the IO side (uploading from ov2640 camera in jpeg format)
* This week:
   * TBD
   * Maybe saving BMP images, with or without
   * Port in phil b’s filters
   * Make sure there’s a stable release of adafruit_ticks
