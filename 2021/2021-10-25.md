### 3:02 Python Developer's Survey 2021

Join the Python Developers Survey 2021 - this year the PSF conducting the fifth iteration of the official Python Developers Survey. The goal is to capture the current state of the language and the ecosystem around it. By comparing the results with last year's, they can identify and share with everyone the hottest trends in the Python community and the key insights into them - [Survey Link](https://surveys.jetbrains.com/s3/c1-python-developers-survey-2021) and information via the [Python Software Foundation](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2021/10/join-python-developers-survey-2021.html).

Also - do you know someone who should be a Python Software Foundation Fellow but isn't yet? Nominate them before November 20, 2021, and PSF will add them to the list for considering Q4 2021 fellows - [Nomination instructions](https://python.org/psf/fellows/).

18:04 @jepler
* Adafruit’s Communty moderators on Discord for the way we work together on moderation problems that are more complex than “ban an obvious spammer”


18:28 @jerryn
* @danh and @neradoc for the quick identification and fix to the requests library
* @jepler for jumping in an handing a moderation issue in #offtopic




18:54 @kattni
* @sommersoft for submitting the adabot fixes for Hacktoberfest labelling and circuitpython.org/contributing
* @danh for assisting me with a core PR
* @cater for help with a guide late last week
* @danh for continued help with updating a guide
* @todbot for immense patience
* To the Community Moderators on Discord for thoughtfully and effectively applying our community standards in both obvious and less obvious situations
* @KeithTheEE for joining the CircuitPythonLibrarians review team!


19:52 @makermelissa
* @AdamCummick for updating Blinka to split the board definitions of the RaspBerry Pi 4/CM4 from the other boards.
* Group Hug


15:33 @tannewt
* @hathach for getting usb going on the raspberry pi
* @maholli for the SAMD sleep work
* @danh and @daveputz for the pulsein fix


## 20:14 Status Updates
21:57 @danh
* Finished fix of SAMD21 PDMIn problem. Now getting good microphone data.
* HID boot keyboard/mouse support and feature report support are now merged in.
* Fixed some argument checking bugs.
* Doing a lot of reading and research on cooperative multitasking alternatives for CircuitPython, such as asyncio, Curio, Trio, eventio, and asynccp. First step will be to get MicroPython’s asyncio implementation working, and then consider adding structured concurrency support on top of it.


24:15 @foamyguy
* Reviewing type PRs and a circuitpython.org PR
* Documented some best practices for using PyCharm in the welcome to circuitpython guide
* Worked on scripts to automate adding a documentation link text to the readme files in the libraries.


25:10 @jepler
* Last week:
   * I’m having more trouble than usual getting my github activity, because I now have something automated pusing every hour, 24 hours a day
   * Implemented watchdog for samd51 (PR merged)
   * Implemented gifio (based on openmv) (PR in progress)
   * Improved SD card speed by using “CMD25” better (PR in progress)
* This week:
   * Continued work on gifio & sd card writing -- looking for more optimizations.  Getting to 10FPS when recording a QVGA (320x240) GIF would be amazing
   * My ‘if I need a break’ task is to add dithering of images to B&W to print on a thermal printer


27:02 @jerryn
* Hoping to have more time “real soon now” to get back to CP. There is a light at the end of the tunnel for the project I am working on (may be an oncoming train ;-)


27:22 @kattni
* Last week:
   * Published the ATtiny817 breakout guide
   * Started updating the Welcome to CircuitPython guide
   * Got most of the VL53L1X guide finished - held up on Arduino lib not being in IDE
* This morning:
   * Added VL53L1X to the Arduino IDE
   * Continued work on the Welcome guide
   * Merge the fix for circuitpython.org/contributing and hacktoberfest labeling.
* This week:
   * Finish VL53L1X guide
   * Continue working on the Welcome guide overhaul
   * Couple of miscellaneous things that were waiting on me having the necessary hardware
   * More PrettyPins


29:45 @makermelissa
* Last Week:
   * Finished adding file functions to Code Editor
   * Worked on bug fixes on Code Editor
   * Added some small BLE File Transfer bug fixes
   * Tested out a PR for Splitting the Raspberry Pi boards in Blinka
   * Started working on Mobile UI Updates for the Code Editor
   * Found a bug in the CircuitPython Core when connecting with a mobile device
* This Week:
   * Continue working the Mobile UI Updates


20:46 @tannewt
* Lots of progress on the Raspberry Pi CircuitPython version last week. USB and HDMI now work.
* Refresh is pretty slow so I’ll be looking into enabling the caches.
* Will also PR to tinyusb. That needs to happen before we can PR the port into CP.


## 31:05 In The Weeds
31:21 @foamyguy - Wondering if there is any interest in publishing .pyi stubs to PyPi for libraries that are otherwise not published in PyPi, which are mostly microcontroller device specific libraries that aren’t meant to work with Blinka.
* @jepler - I wonder if we should publish it for the bundle, so that there aren’t blooptillion new stubs libraries
* @kattni - There are a limited number of libraries that fall into this category. So publishing to PyPI may be a reasonable idea.
* @foamyguy - Typeshed may be another option: https://github.com/python/typeshed if I understand correctly this repo holds typing stubs for many different 3rd party projects 
* https://pypi.org/project/stub-generator/
* @KeithTheEE - If there's any attempt at running code execution, you can raise a warning as an extra layer?
