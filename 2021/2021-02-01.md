### 4:42 LCA 2021 Online Keynote: The Story Behind Blinka by Limor Fried
Limor Fried, founder of Adafruit, gave a keynote talk on the "The Story Behind Blinka" discussing CircuitPython at Linux Conference Australia 2021. The video is now available - YouTAMC stockube

### 5:24 Die shots of the Raspberry Pi RP2040 chip
An informative thread on Twitter, starting with x-rays of the new Raspberry Pi Pico board and subsequently going layer by layer through the board’s RP2040 chip. The die shots are both beautiful and informative in understanding this new chip. The thread indicates the chip is made in 40nm and at the TSMC fab - Adafruit Blog and Twitter with zoomable image.

### 6:12 27,000 thanks!
The Adafruit Discord community, where we do all our CircuitPython development in the open, reached over 27,000 humans, thank you! Adafruit believes Discord offers a unique way for CircuitPython folks to connect. Join today at https://adafru.it/discord.

### 6:40 pip updates
pip is the package installer for Python. pip installs packages from the Python Package Index. A late January update introduced two important changes: Support for Python 2 has been removed. Also support for Python 3.5 has been removed. More - pip.pypa.io

7:07 The CircuitPython Weekly Newsletter is a CircuitPython community-run newsletter emailed every Tuesday. The complete [archives are here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/). It highlights the latest Python on hardware related news from around the web including CircuitPython, Python and MicroPython developments. 
To contribute your own news or project, edit next week's draft [on GitHub](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython-weekly-newsletter/tree/gh-pages/_drafts) and no[submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository/) with the changes.

## 25:39 Status Updates
26:08 @tannewt
* Upgrading my computer!
* Wrote a lot of audio code last week. Need to regroup on it and get it going.
* Graham pointed me to the interpolator which could be very useful for the sample conversion to the output formats.


28:16 @TG-Techie
* Last Week:
   * Started on docs, almost finished (set a micro goal). The docs inspired the live-stream content
   * Got an app launcher for the TG-Watch working, having some memory “leaks” after de-imports
   * Live streamed a small project with the TG-Gui making a n RGB hex miser on the pyportal
      * Possibly too simple? Need to find a good level of complexity
      * Open to feedback
* Next Week:
   * Finish Docs, mirror video
   * Make and pr a more ram conservatice version of Display Shapes
   * Start on a universal CircuitPython driver
   * Try out kmatch98’s toggle if there is time 

@anecdata (lurking)


30:22 @brentru (lurking) 
* CircuitPython_Datetime library released
   * Subset of CPython datetime library
* Updated MiniMQTT
   * ESP32SPI, ESP32S2, CPython compatibility
   * Releasing this week

@cater (lurking)


@CGrover (just listening)


@charlesburnaford (lurking)


31:06 @danh
* Released 6.2.0-beta.1
* Did a lot of reviewing and troubleshooting.
* Puzzled out a confusing problem with @hierophect having to do with `hash(Socket)`.
* Started on secondary USB CDC channel implementation.


@dave P (lurking)


33:18 @David.Glaude (lurking)
* PIO/Pico/RP2040:
   * Killing my first Pico (either DoA or it’s my soldering)
   * Testing “traditional” Neopixel & PIO Neopixel on Pico
   * Trying to implement blink or similar in PIO
* Non CP: A lot of Shenzhen I/O playing


@deshipu(lurking)


34:01 @foamyguy
* Last week
   * Moved a few enhancements that Jeff created into the display_text library. Ascent/Descent use in bitmap_label and wrapping by pixels.
   * Created initial repo code for DisplayIO_Layouts library
   * Made a video covering the process of making stubs and using them with PyCharm.
* This week
   * Finalize code and make PR for a new statically sized label class. It will be made to work nicely with the new wrapping function, and GridLayout, and other layouts in the new DisplayIO_Layout library.
   * Followup on feedback for the initial Layouts code and add at least one more example for GridLayout


@garyz (lurking)


35:45 @hierophect
* Last week:
   * Dug into some problems in the Requests library, which were related to issues in Socket, including error reporting problems and funky hash-related issue. 
   * Fixed an issue in Socket related to timeouts
   * Got set up for low power and tried out some basic tests with the Monsoon power monitor
   * Fixed various ongoing issues with the SSLSocket PR
* This week:
   * Taking a break from Socket to fix STM32 I2C issues and low power, been saying I’ll do this for weeks and now I actually can
   * Unless I decide to go back and do more socket functions
   * Which I might
   * Also going to try some ESP-NOW stuff this week on personal time, will hopefully see if CPy implementation is practical.


38:14 @Hugo (lurking)
* This week:
   * I’m having a go at making a vertical progressbar. I’ve started working on [breaking] changes for the “adafruit_circuitpython_progressbar” to allow for both horizontal and vertical progress bars from the same class. Open to suggestions whether it should be a major version update, or a new/separate library.
   * Part of the changes will include an example for the Matrix Portal for both the current version as well as the new one


@Jayguitar (lurking)


38:50 @jepler (out this week)

* On a personal note:
   * My GitHub sponsorship profile is live: https://github.com/sponsors/kattni
   * Thank you again to all my sponsors!
   * I spun up a website using Pelican which runs on Python, and managed to figure out editing a theme, which is starting to look something like what I want.


@kevin_thomas (lurking, text only)


45:53 @kmatch98 
Last week
* Finished PR for ParallelBus on ESP32-S2 to support fast parallel displays (similar to the pyportal)
* Built a demo widget (sliding switch)

This week
* Better comprehend proposed “Control” and “Widget” class structure and ‘Class’ify my first widget
Fun stuff:
* Made a “sliceform” paper torus 


47:27 @MakerMelissa
* Last Week:
   * Wrote up a guide on using CircuitPython and Home Assistant
   * Converted a couple more Shell scripts over to Python
   * Added some deinit code for the External BitbangIO library
   * Tested some Pull Requests
* This Week:
   * Catch up on some GitHub Issues such as a MatrixPortal update
   * Test out ESPHome with the ESP32-S2
   * Hopefully I can get to some Blinka Displayio stuff soon


48:16 @Mark(Gamblor) [lurking, may be text only]
* Working to add displayio.ParallelBus support to RP2040. Waiting on a display to arrive Tuesday to test it.


@minoraxis (lurking)


@Mr. Certainly [lurking]

## 48:44 In The Weeds
49:16 @TG-Techie:
*  What happens the compiled byte-code after a file is parsed and compiled? 
   * When importing and exporting module the first import takes up some space that cannot be freed but after that any re-import can be full cleared 
      * [probably not the byte-code], may be the strings. Local var names will be “inturned” into the qstr tables. May be a PR that can help with this.
   * Are files being cached or is there just no mechanism for freeing compiled files? 
   * Need for an app switcher / manager, or reference finder tool PR?


56:06 @jerryn
* Issue with native busdevice
   * See https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/4109
      * Initially filed against LIS3DH library
   * The issue is resolved if native BusDevice is not used. 
   * Can also resolve by building with LONGINT_IMPL = MPZ
      * But then it won’t fit in Flash unless something else is removed.
