## 4:08 Community News
### 4:10 Python Becomes the #1 Programming Language via TIOBE
For the first time in more than 20 years, the TIOBE programming language index a new leader of the pack: the Python programming language. The long-standing hegemony of Java and C is over. Python, which started as a simple scripting language, as an alternative to Perl, has become mature. Its ease of learning, its huge amount of libraries, and its widespread use in all kinds of domains, has made it the most popular programming language of today. Congratulations Guido van Rossum and the many contributors to the Python ecosystem! - [TIOBE](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/).
### 4:50 Mu editor version 1.1.0-beta.6 is out with Multilanguage Support
Beta 6 of the Python editor Mu is now available, with a dozen changes including multilanguage support - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/10/06/mu-editor-version-1-1-0-beta-6-is-out-with-multilanguage-support-mu-python/) and [madewith.mu](https://madewith.mu/mu/users/2021/10/06/beta6.html).
Download the software free at [codewith.mu](https://codewith.mu/).
### 5:27 Over 3,000 Closed Pull Requests in CircuitPython Core!
There have now been over 3,000 closed (both merged and unmerged) Pull Requests in CircuitPython core, showing just how much active development has been happening!  From CircuitPython's humble beginnings to CircuitPython 7.0.0, this open source project keeps getting better and better - [GitHub](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed).
### 6:05 The Stage Game Library for CircuitPython is Ported to the Pimoroni PicoSystem
With the help of Gadgetoid at Pimoroni, Deshipu has ported the CircuitPython Stage game library to Pimoroni PicoSystem, a Raspberry Pi Pico-based gaming device. Both Vacuum Invaders and Jumper Wire work fine  - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/deshipu/status/1446076574370045960).
Learn more about the Stage game library - [Adafruit Learning System](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-stage-game-library).
### 6:45 Guido van Rossum Talks About Speeding Up Python
The Software at Scale Podcast 34 presents "Faster Python with Guido van Rossum". They discuss Guido’s new work on making CPython faster (PEP 659), Tiers of Python Interpreter Execution, and high impact, low hanging fruit performance improvements - [Software at Scale](https://www.softwareatscale.dev/p/software-at-scale-34-faster-python).
### 7:13 A Limited-Edition CircuitPython 7 Poster Available
A limited-edition CircuitPython 7 Poster is now available from Adafruit. Unlike previous releases, the printer could only make a small number of posters and they are expected to go quickly - [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5067).

We’re seeing an influx of people, possibly due to hacktober fest, picking up those good first issues. Thank you to everyone who has been stepping up to review those PRs because obviously we're not doing the whole process if we don’t review them.

## 14:40 Hug reports
15:14 @charlesburnaford(lurking) 
* Group hug 


15:20 @danh
* @kattni, @jepler, and @tannewt for introducing me to running the meeting: @kattni for helping out with several recording trials, @jepler for the running the meeting doc, and @tannewt for initiating the whole meeting thing and setting the protocol.


16:04 @David.Glaude (lurking) 
* @danh for running the meeting
* @BeBoXos for four times in a row with a project in the newsletter
* Group hug (too many people to thanks since my last contribution to “The Meeting”)


16:26 @foamyguy
* @markgamblor for reviewing type info PRs
* @jeff and @microdev for reviewing and offering improvements for a PR to core to fix an issue with passing None for a bus when initializing displays.
* @neradoc and @todbot for helping me get to safemode on Raspberry Pi pico, and showing some ideas for attaching a reset button


17:09 @jepler
* Group hug
* @ladyada -- we’ve had a chance to work directly together on the OV5640 camera stuff and that’s always nice (even if my code is not always up to snuff on the first run)
* @danh thanks for running the meeting
* @kmatch98, @david.glaude nice to see some faces who have been on a break.


17:52 @kattni
* @danh for running the meeting for the first time!
* @foamyguy for reviewing a PR on the Learn repo for a community-contributed update to one of his examples
* @Hem for jumping into the Community Helpers role and providing a ton of assistance to folks on Discord
* @foamyguy and @mark(Gamblor) for reviewing the incoming PRs from new folks.
* @jepler and @cater for helping me understand the ATtiny8x7 breakout
* @cater for helping me test the ATtiny8x7 breakout 
* Group hug!


19:31 @kmatch (text only)
* CedarGrove for the espresso-weighing scale GUI on a PyPortal. Any interest in turning your code chunks into a reusable CircuitPython Widget? (https://circuitpython.readthedocs.io/projects/displayio-layout/en/latest/api.html#widget)


19:56 @MakerMelissa
* @tannewt for clarifying some things about the BLE File Transfer library. It made finishing it up much faster.
* @danh for running the meeting.
* Group Hug


20:17 @tannewt
* @EmergReanimator for the NXP PR.
* @foamyguy for doing type addition reviews
## 20:49 Status Updates
21:11 @danh
* Boot keyboard support for HID. This is on indefinite hold due to conflicts between being able to support old BIOS’s that don’t do USB HID very well and supporting the Windows 7/8.1 drivers, which require some fixed USB assignments. I tried simplifying the drivers to be more like Windows 10. This is unfortunately not possible for third-party drivers: they can’t be “class drivers”.
* Still might add “feature reports” to HID.
* Fixing various and sundry bugs for 7.x.
* Running the meeting for the first time!


23:19 @David.Glaude (lurking) 
* Discovered "CALM" from YouTuber @titimoby and his discord full of French makers.
* Contribution to other people's projects...
   * @CGrover's CO2 sensor:
      * Test and discussion on the design including UART PM25 version
      * Fixed the French translation of CGrover CO2 sensor
   * @BeBoXos PyBasic and basicpython with physical I2C keyboard:
      * @BeBoXos made PyBasic working FeatherWing Keyboard and on Wio Terminal and PyPortal (Titano) with an I2C keyboard
      * presented to @BeBoXoS my #CircuitPython2021 idea of a CircuitPython computer and @tannewt’s basicpyhton
* Recent acquisition:
   * BLE Cat Printer (because of Jepler)
   * m5stack I2C CardKB keyboard (because of BeBoXos)
   * 555 (not even because of Lady Ada)




24:43 @foamyguy
* Last week
   * Reviewing type PRs
   * Make helper library for waveshare pico LCD addon
   * Uncovered an issue with using None for bus by accident when initializing displays. Figured out how to fix it in the core and made PR
* This week
   * More type PRs
   * Generalizing tilemap helper to work with different sized tiles and working on a pacman clone


26:02 @jepler
* Last week:
   * OV5640 camera
* This week:
   * Looks like more OV5640 camera. The base functionality is quite good. Including work this morning, most of the functionality works, and I found a way to boost the frame rate quite a bit, so if you saw my one minute video last week with the really low frame rate it’s about 15 frames per second now.
* Personal stuff:
   * WWVB is a radio time signal transmitted from near Fort Collins Colorado by NIST. I’m working on logging the reception of the signal at my house using an inexpensive receiver module, to be called wwvb-observatory. It’s written in Python and runs on a Raspberry Pi.


27:08 @kattni
* Last week:
   * Finished my part of the EyeLights LED Glasses guide
   * Started the ATtiny8x7 STEMMA QT seesaw breakout guide
   * Started adding support to CircuitPython for the ATtiny8x7 seesaw breakout
* This week:
   * Took Monday off for Canadian Thanksgiving
   * ATtiny8x7 breakout guide - this is a fairly involved guide with many examples each requiring GIFs.
   * More PrettyPins
* In other news:
   * Picked up two Yubikey Bios, which are standard Yubikeys but with fingerprint sensors. Haven’t set them up yet, but looking forward to it.


28:48 @Maker Melissa
* Last Week:
   * Finished up the JavaScript BLE File Transfer library updates
   * Continued working on the CircuitPython Code Editor improvements that relied on the File Transfer Library updates
* This Week:
   * Finish up the Code Editor updates
   * Test the Code Editor on other devices and make adjustments as necessary


29:02 @tannewt
* Continuing to work on the Raspberry Pi.
   * Last week has been mostly working on interrupts and learning about the interrupt controller.
   * Now working on initializing the USB peripheral in device mode.
