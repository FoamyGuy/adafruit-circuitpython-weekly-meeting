### 3:02 Adafruit Learn System Project Bundle
New in the Adafruit Learn System: Project Bundles! Gone are the days of digging through the Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle to find the libraries you need. You can now easily download the code, libraries, and any images, sounds and so on, in one zip file.
To use the Project Bundle:
Above any embedded code in a guide in the Adafruit Learn System, you'll find a Project Zip link.

Click the link to download the Project Bundle zip.

Open the Project Bundle zip to find the example code, all necessary libraries, and, if available, any images, sounds, etc.


Simply copy all the files over to your CIRCUITPY drive, and you're ready to go!
Check it out in your next guide in the [Adafruit Learn System](https://learn.adafruit.com/)!
This feature is still new, so there may be changes to how it works in the near future. For example, we intend to make the link more obvious.
If you run into any problems or bugs, or would like to submit feedback, please [file an issue](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides/issues) on the Adafruit Learning System Guides GitHub repo.

## 26:40 Status Updates


@anecdata (lurking)


31:55 @danh
* Released 6.2.0 final last week. Release went smoothly.
* Filed an issue with GitHub about unnecessary new notifications.
* Added commentary to I2C/wifi PR’s @MakerMelissa filed on ESP-IDF.
* Started on dynamic USB descriptors. First task is modifying and enhancing the `adafruit_usb_descriptor` tool library to generate separate descriptors and note places in each descriptor that need to be changed when concatenating the descriptors.


33:59 @david.glaude (lurking)
* Participated in Open Hardware Summit thanks to @jfurcean !!!
* Shared with ATMakersBill the historical discord discussion for “one CP board pretending to be a BLE keyboard for two different computers” to try to help with similar requirements. My dual BLE mouse jiggler code: https://gist.github.com/dglaude/a765ee9fe0aea6dc0f6298a8a734c2bb
* Non CP: Made an IKEA hack with four Kallax “shelving unit” and a two persons bed on top.


34:28 @foamyguy
* Last Week (light on CircuitPython activity):
   * Working on Tiled map games for CircuitPython has re-ignited my interest in web/pc game development. I’ve been diving back into JavaScript game development with the Phaser3 Library
   * With the help of an Ourcade explainer video I learned about breadth first search algorithm and successfully implemented it to create “point and click” character movement in a tilemap game. https://youtu.be/KwZgpPnqgLU 
* This week
   * Learn about A* algorithm to make the pathfinding more efficient
   * Finish up the new pages for the custom font learn guide
   * Re-implement these pathfinding algorithms with CircuitPython to ensure I have a solid understanding of how to use them
   * Begin working on setting up new individual repos for displayio widgets.


36:17 @hierophect
* Last week
   * Moved back to Boston! New office, etc
   * Working on the RP2040 power implementation
   * Merged in API changes into the NRF port
   * Looking over the reset issues on that port
* This week:
   * RP2040 Sleep but not getting interrupted by moving stuff
   * Look at a supervisor runtime report error
   * Resolve any remaining issues with power PRs so they can get merged in properly


38:01 @Hugo
* Last week
   * Work on some string inconsistencies
   * Adding some glossary definitions and terms to the Weblate project to help provide information and context to the wonderful translation helpers
   * Update progress bar samples
* This week
   * Review strings that are translated for additional stylistic consistency
   * Finish updating progress bar examples. For realsies
   * Look at open issues and PRs for places I can help (requests accepted)


@Jayguitar (lurking)


40:32 @jepler
* Last week:
   * Continued work on imxrt i2sout.  Learning the ins&outs of DMA, which has a lot of parts. Code’s almost complete, but before I can test on the 1010-EVK board I also need to learn how to “program” the I2S DAC, which needs to be told via I2C how to behave. (or figure out whether the i2s pins are exposed to the arduino-style headers, which they may not be)
   * Found & fixed a problem with the uf2 bootloader installation process on imxrt
   * Drafted a Learn guide page about using the firmware erase uf2 on imxrt (similar to “nuke.uf2”)
   * Filed some PRs to enable RGBMatrix on the Feather M4 CAN
   * With Dan’s help, factored out the IncrementalEncoder source that interprets the signals and turns them into counts; this will enable someone try different algorithms.  It also fixed a problem that Dan noticed where the RP2040 encoder went the opposite direction of the others!
   * Helped out with some CI problems that were affecting Adafruit_CircuitPython_DisplayIO_Color_Picker
   * Reviewed & Merged stuff
   * Found some links for the newsletter.  It’s not just aimlessly browsing the internet if it gives you newsletter links.
   * Fixed a bug in the `re` module (I may have mentioned this in an earlier meeting; fixed this in Micropython first); used an automated tool (“fuzzer”) to look for additional re-module problems but didn’t find any (yay!)  Now “too complex” regular expressions will raise exceptions instead of behaving in odd ways.
* This week:
   * Hopefully wrapping i2sout
* Fun stuff:
   * Designed & 3D printed a [“birdhouse”-style enclosure](https://twitter.com/jeffepler/status/1381646328703426570) for a Raspberry Pi project. (challenge: could not find a drawing of the Raspberry Pi PoE Hat with the location of the fan accurately dimensioned!)


44:48 @jerryn
* Last week
   * Continued head scratching about issue with stmpe610 on featherp2040 with featherwing tft display.
      * Will not init stmpe610 after soft reboot
      * The issue does not occur if the display is “released” before soft reboot.
      * Hopefully this is a clue…
   * Playing with new FunHouse
* Next week
   * Try to understand more about the stmpe610 issue
   * Keep playing with toys.
* Non CP - Found issue accessing Adafruit Learn Guides from Raspberry Pi (Buster)
   * Console would hang --- need power cycle to recover
   * Workaround from RPi forum - disable hardware acceleration -- works

* Add a color morphing function to DisplayIO_Animation
* Implement initial protocol for talking to a TinyLogicFriend 


52:37 @MakerMelissa
* Last Week:
   * Added 16 new boards to circuitpython.org between Blinka and CircuitPython
   * Updated circuitpython-build-tools to work with repos without .git in the URL
   * Updated WebSerial ESPTool to provide a more meaningful error message if it fails to change baud rate
   * Wrote the FunHouse library
   * Tested if esphome was working any better with esp32-s2. It was, but WiFi + I2C is still an issue.
   * Updated the requirements on several libraries
   * Started on a FunHouse/Home Assistant guide
* This Week:
   * Finish up the FunHouse/Home Assistant guide
   * Work on the FunHouse product guide


27:08 @tannewt
* Gave my “Outside In” design talk at OHS.
* Started doing basic optimization on BLE file transfer protocol for sending more bytes at a time.
* Waiting on protocol feedback and will start bringing it into CircuitPython this week.
* Also going to dust off my xcode and get pyleap building.
* Figure out how to post a tip to a PR when the CI fails.

* Weird idea of storing washington state laws in git as-if legislatures used git all along.


29:14 @ TG-Techie
Last week:
* Seg faulted cpython runtime
* Continue work on watch (saved from from mpy)
* learn about circuitpython internals (have some in the weeds questions)
* Non-CP:
   * Finally “got”-ish DiffEqs 
   * Playing around with custom language transpiler more just for kicks
Next Week:
* See if I am able to add a time capsule module to circuitpython w/ current level of understanding.
* Continue reading /py folder to understand const comp / how circuitpython do
   * so far it has been: OMG WAH IS GOING ON? When not inside a single function




## 53:46 In The Weeds


54:17 @tannewt - I’ve started to use the CircuitPython github org for libraries that multiple folks are writing and maintaining together. If you’d like to be a member let me know. Folks who have been active already are welcome. I want to avoid solo developer libraries on the org though because they are repos I want us to collectively support. We should work to moving the community bundle there.

CP internals questions:
* Why is the `id =const(value)` put into something called `dynamic constants`? / why does that dict only support ints and not other literals or objects (tbc: not a feature request).
* Excluding pointer-int packing mp_obj_t objects are always pointers right?
* Not Question: The CP internals are “written in c”, as a neophyte it feels like a DSL for CP
