@anecdata (lurking)


25:32 @CGrover (text only)
* No CircuitPython activity to report this week. 
* Unrelated: The book illustration project is nearly complete. Have my drawing skills improved and am I having fun? Yes and yes. Are the new skills good enough to put food on the table? Only if drawn there.


25:59 @danh
* More discussions on getting I2C devices to work well on the RP2040. It’s now clear that an I2C timing requirement needed to be considered. I have a new PR for our fork of the pico-sdk.
* After the RP2040 I2C final fix is incorporated, we should be able to make a CircuitPython 6.2.0 release candidate.
* I’m now thinking about how to do dynamic USB and USB HID descriptors, and will start working on that for 7.0.0.


29:07 @David.Glaude (text only)
* Went on Show&Tell to show how to piggyback an I2C sensor on a StemmaQT board
* Portable C02 sensor with Feather RP2040 + OLED + SCD30: https://twitter.com/DavidGlaude/status/1375557719646740482?s=20
* Checking for a friend the lowest cost bill of material for a school CO2 sensor:
   * Testing SCD30 + QT-Py and using color to indicate a level
   * Made a strip down version of led-animation to fit the non-haxpress QT-Py
   * “Accidentally” discovered the flatulence detector capacity of the sensor CO2 sensor: https://twitter.com/DavidGlaude/status/1376529884349075456?s=20
* Tested DJ Hero for Wii driver
* “Customised” the MagTag Vaccination progress bar for Belgium to match a Twitter bot value (we only count and give vaccine to >18): https://twitter.com/DavidGlaude/status/1375249364508143616?s=20


30:07 @foamyguy
* Last Week
   * Reviewing PRs in display_text and displayio_layout
   * Try to decrease memory usage in the EZ Make project. Streamed this work on Friday evening while Scott was off so no deep dive.
   * Implement player movement, collision checking,  for Tiled game files. Also begun implemented camera view to show a subset of the map
* This week
   * Another pass through open displayio library PRs
   * Working on enhancements to the custom font learn guide
   * Continue implementing Tiled game functionality and attempt to make a more complex game with it instead of a basic movement example.


32:52 @hierophect
* Last week:
   * Wrapped up the STM32 low power module, with the exception of one remaining bug
   * Fixed a redundancy in the deep sleep manager in Main that was calling the alarm system constantly in a confusing way, thanks again to @danh for helping to confirm it
   * Reviewed the new changes to the power API from Jun2Sak
   * Put in a PR to try and help synchronize between the NRF and STM32 low power
* This week:
   * Get started on RP2040 low power
   * Pin down issue with STM32 returning wakeup alarm properly in certain deep sleep setups.


34:49 @Hugo
* Last 2 weeks
   * Wrapped up refactor of progress bars
      * Includes examples, etc.
   * Looked into MagTag bitmap crash loop
      * No dice on repro yet. Might be obsolete
* This week
   * Look into new issues on backlog
   * Setup new PC (assuming delivery) to get back into CP/Lib devs ASAP


35:50 @jepler [missing meeting]
 Last week:
* SPI output on i.MX had some surprises to conquer, I think it’s solid now
* Found & fixed two problems preventing adafruit_sdcard from working with bitbangio
* Fixed some example code based on feedback in the learn system
* Added some tests to adafruit_pioasm, hoping someone else will add more
* Fixed a problem with datatime.timedelta.total_seconds() losing precision.  Now long intervals are integer number of seconds and short intervals can have microseconds.
* Addressed feedback on Learn system guides
* Ran into an assertion error in the `re` module, would cause arbitrary misbehavior on mcu. Filed a patch with micropython, should also PR it for circuitpython.
* Ran into a problem with `memoryview(rgbmatrix)`, filed a PR
This week:
* Either moving on to PWMOut
* Or moving on to reports that the IMXRT1020-EVK doesn’t boot (possibly since 5.3.0)
* Or bringing up IMXRT1024-EVK (similar to 1020 but has flash embedded in the microprocessor package)
Fun stuff:
* Hope to return to enhancing PulseIn to work with longer pulses for one of my own projects


37:14 @jerryn 
* Managed to reproduce an issue with stmpe610 and feather Rp2040 but only with MacOS, not on Raspberry Pi….  now have something to follow up with.
* Continued looking at fingerprint library -- found another command that only works on some sensors. Not a big deal since not may folks even know about the extra commands...yet. Still investigating why one command needs an extra delay.
* New Mu 1.1.0-beta.3 actually works on my Mac -- woohoo!!
* Crocuses are blooming!!


39:11 @jfurcean (text only)
* Added led_on() function to adafruit_hid.keyboard to check the status of caps lock, scroll lock, num lock, and compose.
* Fixed the init in tft_featherwing_24 and tft_featherwing_35 to be able to use “non-standard”/non-adafruit feather boards. 


39:37 @Jose David (Text Only)
        Last Week
* Cartesian widget
* Take a brief look at the Peripherals PICO registers. Not much progress.
* PR on the equalizer widget. Inspired by @askpatrickw’s on the audio mixer

* New candlestick class, graphical representation of stock market price movement using CircuitPython added to the Community Bundle
        This week
* Styles library, and getting this in the widgets library
* Slider Widget


40:22 @kattni
* Last week:
   * First time publishing the newsletter on my own - still had help with content.

   * Went through a ton of guide feedback. Down to things that involve others or significant testing needed.
   * Published the CYBERDECK Bonnet and HAT guide
   * Handed off MIDI FeatherWing guide
   * Continued Template Quest

* Study up on sigrok and TinyLogicFriend (from exactly 1 year ago @tannewt’s deep dive) and Gamblor’s Rasp Pico logic analyzer


44:28 @MakerMelissa
* Last Week:
   * Finished the JSON file generation which makes it easier to get a list of all the libraries and their dependencies
   * I got the Dynamic Rebundler working so you can go to a URL, specify the libraries you want and it will rebundle the main bundle to a mini bundle along with dependencies on the fly.
   * Started working on getting the existing CircuitPython VSCode plugin figured out both in terms of usage and internal functionality.
* This Week:
   * Get the Dynamic Rebundler into its final place so people can start using it
   * Help update the CircuitPython VSCode plugin so it has some of the updated functionality of CircUp
   * Maybe start on a UI for the Dynamic Rebundler so people can make their own packages easily.


45:47 @Mark(gamblor) [lurking]
* Last Week:
   * Audiomixer works on RP2040 now and should work on any non M4 board but only tested on RP2040 for now
* Other fun stuff:
   * Tomorrow I survived another trip around the sun


22:37 @tannewt
* Switched RP2040 and generic external flash to nvm.toml. Make sure to init submodules to get data/nvm.toml
* Finishing up switching iMX RT to nvm.toml in CP and tinyuf2
* Then, onto BLE workflow. Will likely start stubbing out BLE from CP Python to unblock Trevor on the app side.

46:38 @kmatch I see periodic “out of memory” questions in the discord chats. What are good resources to help folks with general memory usage and debugging, fragmentation topics and good practices?


* See “Memory” in: https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/frequently-asked-questions
* Deeper dive via microPython and very relevant to CircuitPython: https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/reference/constrained.html
* @foamyguy did a Friday stream on saving memory on the EZbake oven specifically for the PyPortal Titano: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=lDAyfZp_350&feature=youtu.be
* Any other intermediate-level guides or examples for problem solving
* Tip: Do a gc.collect() prior to large allocations
* Others
   * There was the "use bytearray" advice.
   * And use binary font (unsure).
   * Reduce color depth.
   * Avoid recursivity? May cause “pystack exhausted”
   * Use generator rather than build big list.


* Needs: Tool for measuring the memory use of libraries
* @anecdata (Text Only) Is a defragmenter function accessible to CirPy a possibility? → not practical given current heap implementation; Moore’s Law improves the situation over time


59:49 @Jose David: (Text Only)
related with kmatch, do we need, with functions and patterns are more memory and time consuming in circuitpython, to avoid using them in libraries, is this architecture dependant, ie. ESP32S2 bus, etc
