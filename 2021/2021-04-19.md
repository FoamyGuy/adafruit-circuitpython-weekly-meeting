CircuitPython now available for 200 boards!
 200 boards! 

There are now 200 boards that support CircuitPython! The Slide Trinkey - SAMD21 is board number 200.
 200 boards! 

CircuitPython, available in 15 different languages, is the one of the easiest ways to program microcontrollers. We began with the Circuit Playground Express approximately three years ago, and reached 100 boards in January 2020 with the Open Hardware Summit badge. Now, over a year later, we've reached 200 boards. Chips supported include: Espressif, Microchip SAMDs, Nordic, NXP, RP2040s, ST, and more! Thank you to everyone in our community who has submitted boards to CircuitPython!
Check out the full list on CircuitPython.org!

Overall: I’m still super pleased to see the older PRs being picked up. As well, I’m very excited about all of the updates being made to the libraries through new PRs. Early hug report to everyone who is submitting PRs to the libraries. As always, if you’re waiting on us for something in a current PR, please ping and we’ll try to circle back to it as soon as possible. Otherwise, it’s worth looking at some of the older PRs and deciding what we want to do with them. (The oldest PR is still active!)

## 26:49 Status Updates



27:04 @jepler
* Last week:
   * Spent some time on I2SOut on imxrt10xx, but never had success; setting it aside for a bit
   * Started on support for OV7670 cameras & parallel capture device on SAMD51. Have already been able to capture an image with CircuitPython
* This week:
   * There were some things in the I2SOut branch that I should pull out and PR in their own right
   * Polishing a CP library for setting up the OV7670 camera & a core module for parallel image capture. Both are needed before the camera is usable
   * Identify any missing parts to allow the camera image to be fed to a displayio bitmap
   * COVID vaccination later today, my activity this week may be reduced if I have side-effects


29:17 @jerryn
* Totally baffled by stmpe610 issue with displayio on feather rp2040
   * Plan to move the issue from the stmpe610 library to CP
   * Need to do more testing to narrow the description.
   * See https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_STMPE610/issues/16 for the puzzle.
   * Briefly -- SPI reads fail after every other soft reboot….alternately works and fails. Only happens on RP2040 if displayio is also initialized. Works fine on M4 or STM32F405.
* Fun -- Congratulations NASA on the first flight of the Ingenuity helicopter on Mars --It was fun to watch the broadcast this morning and great to see how excited the team was over a very simple line plot showing the altitude!

   * Worked on FunHouse Product guide
   * Learned about making Templates and Template Pages in Adafruit Learn Guides
   * Added a few more boards to circuitpython.org
* This Week:
   * Finish up both guides
   * Play catch-up on some GitHub issues
   * Get back to updating VS Code Extension possibly


40:20 @Mark(Gamblor) [lurking/may be missing]
* Need to look at issues/PRs for something else to work on (suggestions welcome)
* Getting the vaccine Wednesday!


40:49 @tannewt

@anecdata (lurking)


43:01 @danh
* Working on dynamic USB descriptors. Finished Python API for enabling/disabling most devices; HID API not done yet. Rewrote Python descriptor generation script to separate descriptors for reassembly and fixup at run-time, but this is getting out of hand, and I think I will just switch to custom code for each non-HID descriptor.
* Lots of reviews


44:35 @David.Glaude (lurking)

   * Retest TLC59711 LED multiplexer PR.


47:19 @hierophect
* Last week:
   * Rewrote the internal structure of the Alarm module so that things are easier to follow and maintain, starting with the ESP32-S2 as an example. Basically making it so the deep and light sleep processes aren’t overlapping so much when they don’t actually share any code. 
   * Fixed bug on the ESP32-S2 where returned alarm objects don’t match each other
   * Got set up with the RP2040 with the Jlink, gdb debugging, some basic control tests, etc
   * Got started on RP2040 deep sleep functionality, using the RTC and GPIO. 
   * Moved to Boston
* This week:
   * More RP2040 sleep work
   * Other supervisor runtime reason work


48:48 @Hugo
Last week:
* Another update examples for progress bars
* Start work on removing the hard-coded “Adafruit” and “CircuitPython” branding from the core CP code and making it configurable to set at build time
This week
* More work on hard-coded branding. Hopefully get a first pass done for review
* Non-tech
   * Getting 2nd shot Wednesday A.M. So a fun,long drive all the way there and back. In rush hour to boot. Hurray for podcasts!

## 51:11 In The Weeds


@askpatrickw (missing meeting)
I won’t be at the meeting today, but I don’t I’m required for the community to have this conversation.

Potential first candidate repos for CircuitPython GitHub Organization
Other folks, please add the list before the meeting if you like.

* Awesome-circuitpython
* Circup
* Cookiecutter Library Repo … Maybe this is a fork and we modify the Adafruit version so it is more streamlined (it can assume adafruit as the author for example) and then modify the CPorg version so it doesn’t have Adafruit as author logic
* I mentioned “not adafruit.io” IoT libraries:  Adafruit_CircuitPython_AzureIoT, Adafruit_CircuitPython_AWS_IOT, Adafruit_CircuitPython_GC_IOT_Core. May not be the correct list, but these look like libraries the community should support directly.
* Community Bundle
* Circuitpython-org
* The Wii accessories (other than the nunchuck)?
Scott to check with Phil and Limor about these repos.


55:02 @Hugo
* The contributing process learn guide for people who want to contribute to core libraries (Adafruit_CircuitPython_* ones) doesn’t mention the process for requesting reviews. The process is mentioned in the “Creating and Sharing a CircuitPython Library”, however, that is related to a new library within the “Adafruit” organization.

The difficulty comes from requesting a review, which can’t be done without a certain right, role or other permission on the repository (or organization). Without wanting to “@ the wrong people/world”, this seems like it might be a gap in the contributing guide, or perhaps some additional process is needed?

   * While updating library documentation, a lot of the examples and learning guides use busio.I2C to define `I2C`, instead of board.I2C().  The problem arises as, if we intend to use board.I2C() as our standard, adding this documentation to the libraries will imply: modify the simpletest code, modify the readme.rst and testing. Also the learning guide will not be the same as the library code, because it still uses busio.I2C. Busio is also mentioned in the adafruit_bus_device.i2c_device and blinka.busio library documentation.

   * Jose’s Proposal. These peripherals and sensors haven using busio.I2C. (starting 2017 according to the copyright information in some of them),. If there is a new `standard` way to create the I2C: 1. Introduce the new way with a Cut-In (CircuitPython 7 or a specific date). 2. Document the old libraries with the method used in the simpletest.py code. 3. For the new sensors and peripherals libraries use the “new” standard I2C object creation method  if any.
   * @danh: A `board` singleton for STEMMA/QT-connector I2C bus? `board.STEMMA_I2C`? 


   * What is the meaning of   
        This is in https://circuitpython.org/contributing/library-infrastructure-issues, and how to solve this? -
      * @kattni - This was already resolved, but we never updated Adabot on circuitpython.org. I’ll get this taken care of tomorrow. (https://github.com/adafruit/adabot/pull/217)


1:11:18 @foamyguy - circuitpython org: what accounts should be used for readthedocs and PyPi?

      * Started reading about data flow analysis techniques, with the goal of applying these to reducing the size of circuit python libraries.
      * This task grew out of a comment from Kattni about the animations library becoming too big for use on small boards. In general, a circuit python library may have extra code for unneeded functionality; these can be pared-down, depending on what is used, to fit on smaller boards.
      * Data flow analysis can reveal what code depends on what other code or data. This is useful for a compiler optimization called “dead code elimination” and, more recently, “tree shaking” in javascript. These can be ported to python analysis.
      * Idea of “labels” was suggested to refer to a sub-part of the library being used, like “animations/mario” or “animations/flamingo”. These can be hand-built and maintained (like code that runs to remove parts of the library), or a front-end for a data flow analyzer; this second kind would reference all the code entry-points needed to use the library sub-part successfully. Everything else would be removed.
      * Some design work needs to be done to make a usable API for selecting parts of a library--this feature needs more support in circup or another tool, for building and hosting packages for these library sub-parts, or supporting users in making them locally and installing them.
