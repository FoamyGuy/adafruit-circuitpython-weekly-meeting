### 3:20 CircuitPython 7.0.0 Alpha 3 and 6.3.0 Stable Released!
CircuitPython 6.3.0 is the latest minor revision of CircuitPython and is a new stable release. Notable changes since 6.2.0 include many new boards, many corrections to existing boards, the addition of a consistent board.LED to most boards - Adafruit Blog and GitHub Release Notes.

CircuitPython 7.0.0-alpha.3 is an alpha release for CircuitPython 7.0.0. It is relatively stable, but contains a number of issues still to be addressed for 7.0.0. The Python API's it presents may change. Notable additions to 7.0.0 include run-time customization of USB devices, merging in of MicroPython fixes and enhancements as of MicroPython 1.15, simplifications to the RGB status LED codes, and a clocking fix for a few samples of RP2040 boards - Adafruit Blog and GitHub Release Notes.

### 4:20 Raspberry Pi update: RP2040 single chips going on sale now for $1
On Tuesday June 1st, the Raspberry Pi Foundation announced that RP2040 microcontroller chips are available from their Approved Reseller partners in single-unit quantities, allowing people to build their own projects and products on Raspberry Silicon - Raspberry Pi Blog.

### 4:43 pyRTOS: a real-time operating system (RTOS) for CircuitPython
pyRTOS: a real-time operating system (RTOS) for CircuitPython - Adafruit Blog and GitHub.

### 4:57 Adafruit switching default branch of CircuitPython repositories from master to main
Over the course of the next few weeks, Adafruit is switching the CircuitPython repositories to use main as their default branch instead of master. This change is a continuation of past efforts to depart from language deeply rooted in centuries of racism and the subjugation of people based on the color of their skin towards language that is inclusive of everyone. These changes has spark others in the electronic & maker communities (SparkFun, Make, and more) to think about the history of words, how they are used, and changes we can make together - Adafruit Blog.

### 5:58 Q&A with Programming with Microcontrollers in CircuitPython author Armstrong Subero
Apress recently published the book Programming Microcontrollers in CircuitPython. Adafruit asked author Armstrong Subero some questions about both he and the book (and had Armstrong on our SHOW AND TELL too!) - Adafruit Blog.

### 6:25 Weekly Newsletter

Overall: We’re seeing steady work on getting through the older open PRs, as well as keeping up with new PRs. It’s great to see all the work being done, both on the Adafruit and community libraries. We’re working on getting all the libraries moved over to `main` from `master` as the default branch. Please verify whether the library you’re working on has been moved and work within the change. This should be completed in the next few days. If you need help moving your local repo over to `main`, feel free to ask on Discord. The easiest way to do it is to start with a fresh clone.

## 22:03 Status Updates
22:20 @tannewt
* Got directory listing and file reading and writing working from glider. Connecting is still a bit painful.
* Working on improving internal identity key management so that scanning a resolvable address of a bonded peer actually gets resolved by the soft device. This should (hopefully) allow the test script to reconnect after bonding.
* Out starting Thursday through all of next week to visit family.


23:15 @v923z
* Last two months:
   * Reviewed PRs (add scipy.linalg to ulab with two functions, @vikas_udupa)

   * Added cmake support for ESP32, RB2040 (@gadgetoid)
   * Fixed garbage collection problem (@jepler)
   * Updated docs
* Next week(s):
   * Continue work on complex support, and block read support
   * Add option to reduce firmware size at the expense of RAM
   * Try to learn some julia

25:22 @danh (absent)
* Released CircuitPython 6.3.0 and 7.0.0-alpha.3.
