Overall: We’re continuing to work through updating all of our code/examples/etc to work with the breaking changes. Early thank you to foamyguy and lesamouraipourpre for all the work they’ve been putting into this project. We’re still slowly making it through all the older PRs, as usual please ping if you’re waiting on us for anything. There is always a lot going on, but we want to make sure we can enable you to contribute.

## 17:35 Status Updates


17:48 @jepler
* Last week:
   * More camera functionality
   * Adding little bits to guides here and there
* This week:
   * More of the same
* Fun(?) stuff:
   * Long overdue fence replacement going on right outside my window


18:57 @jerryn
* Spent last week being “grandpa” :-)
* This week -- try to get back to testing/breaking things.


19:23 @kattni
* Last week:
   * Added a lib to bundle etc.
   * Made a decision following a discussion with Jeff on his LED Animation PR (and closed it)
   * Documented the MacroPad library in the main MacroPad guide (~6 new pages with demos etc)
   * Started some template cleanup which involved:
      * Getting more code Bundleflied
      * Creating embedded code for Analog In instead of using code directly in the template
      * Updating rainbow code to use `rainbowio` if available and to fall back to `_pixelbuf` or `adafruit_pypixelbuf` if necessary
      * Updating the templates that used rainbow code to remove the individual examples, and use the single template-embedded example, and deleted all the individual examples from the Learning Guides repo
* This week:
   * Continue template cleanup:
      * Still need to update the links in the template descriptions to the examples which were renamed/moved
   * Potential MacroPad shortcut set
   * Add the two new STEMMA RTC boards to the current guides for each once I have hardware in hand
   * Work on new templates / getting current templates added to guides
   * Prep for CircuitPython Day chat with Jeff and Dan
* “Fun” stuff:
   * Our AC is dying, so we have someone out for an estimate and also it is hot.


24:19 @MakerMelissa
* Last Week:
   * Wrote the keypad module for Blinka
   * Started working on a guide that uses Remote Procedure Calls from the MacroPad to the Computer to interface with Home Assistant
      * Just trying to get the Home Assistant settings tweaked so it does what I want and then lots of writing.
   * Worked on some small fixes for WebSerial ESPTool that were preventing it from working with the NVM Generator code I wrote
* This Week:
   * Finish working on MacroPad guide
   * Make sure the NVM Generator code is wrapped up and in a working state.
   * Look into issue with latest Raspberry Pi Kernel breaking things again


25:17 @tannewt
* Diving back into BLE workflow. Seemingly found some LTO assertion issues but can’t figure out why it’s happening. Will spend a little more time on it this week with fresh eyes but move on if it goes nowhere.
* May look into issue where WebBLE editor is getting extra serial characters sent from the device.


27:25 @danh
* Working on revised HID API. Need to test iOS and MacOS tolerance of certain kinds of HID descriptors.
* Making further progress on RP2040 and SAMD51 audio issues.


28:40 @Christian Walther
* Last week: Attended EuroPython online conference, there was one talk about CircuitPython, gave a MicroPython-related lightning talk myself. See https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython-weekly-newsletter/pull/215 for details.
* This week: Apparently my get_previous_traceback() additions broke writing of boot_out.txt, will take a look at that (#5062).




29:13 @foamyguy
* This week
   * Continued work on updating learn guide code for CP7 changes. Knocked out all ulab related changes and some more of the max_size / OnDiskBitmap palette updates. More of these coming next week as well.
   * Started to write out some sample code for vectorio and displayio.Shape hoping to get them refined and then add some supporting text to make it into a guide page for the displayio guide
* Next week
   * Test vectorio PR tonight
   * Look into the Turtle library issue around OnDiskBitmap
   * Streaming at 11am eastern (10am central) on 8/6 to celebrate CircuitPython day.
## 30:49 In The Weeds
@jepler - I want to write a driver for the PCF8563 RTC as found on the Seeeduino XIAO Expansion Board. How do I know whether to contribute it to the Community Bundle or the CircuitPython Bundle?
* @kattni - In general: is it an Adafruit product that Adafruit will support? Yes - CP Bundle, no - Community Bundle. In this case, I would suggest getting Limor’s input though.


## 34:39 Wrap-Up
