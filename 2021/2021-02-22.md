## 13:22 Hug reports

13:51 @jepler
* Group hug
* @tannewt for hosting me on his Deep Dive & everyone who we chatted with
* @v923z for responding promptly to ulab items as usual
* #pcb-design folk including @skerr for giving me compliments on a rather boring PCB design


14:56 @jerryn

* @kmatch98 for reviewing and keeping the conversation open
* @Microdev1 for implementing UART for the pico
* @neradoc for always help in discord. It is inspiring to witness.
* @foamyguy @tannewt thanks for the streams, it is important as a community builder tool.


16:20 @kattni
* Everyone who has contributed to the Adafruit CircuitPython Libraries and the Community Bundle - we have passed 300 total libraries!
* @Hugo for working on adding Pylint to the pre-commit
* @askpatrickw for continued work on circup
* @Kmatch98 and @foamyguy for continuing to work on CircuitPython UI elements

* @jepler - I’ve reflected further on what you did in the bitmap_font library to add PCF fonts.  Not only does this change save space and is faster, but you also created a website to convert files to the right format with one click(!), and added a guide page to explain it all. After using this, it’s clear to me you thought through the whole problem and solved the whole chain of issues, not just one technical piece. To me, this serves as a good example of reducing the many layers of “friction”  focused on solving the full problem at hand. Hugs for sharing your broad set of skills to do this and to set a good example for all of us to strive toward. 
* @Hugo for the improvements in the progress bar and for sharing your positive attitude!

## Mini-In The Weeds
31:02 @ntoll
* We’ve had several contributions of ideas and PRs about changes and fixes to the CircuitPython mode over in the Mu editor repository (see: https://github.com/mu-editor/mu/pull/485#issuecomment-782879502 for a summary). I’d like to raise this here simply so folks have a) visibility of this discussion, and b) feel invited/empowered to take part in it. I’d feel gutted if folks felt left out. Our aim: reach consensus among folks about what, if anything, could/should change in the CircuitPython mode. That’s it..!
* Doodle “A Mu-moot about CircuitPython-mode improvements.”: https://doodle.com/poll/uw4mrfe5kuehxqka

50:10 @askpatrickw (lurking)
* Last week:
   * Updated Circup to:
      * use the requirements.txt released in the bundles (Thanks @Jepler)
      * added pre-commit and made the repo and dev workflow feel like other CircuitPython library repos
   * Using a FeatherS2 and BME680 to monitor my refrigerator. We think the thermostat is off because it is freezing things. 
* This week:
   * Start looking at Azure IoT library work to support Sockets


50:41 @CGrover (text only)
* Submitted the learning guide for improving the low-speed performance of brushed DC motors by adjusting the PWM frequency parameter. Was the result of needing to attain smoother startup movement of the StringCar Racer and other DC motor-based robots. Low-speed movement is especially critical for the String Car when it’s searching for end-of-string, to prevent an acrobatically fatal collision. The guide provides a few practical CircuitPython examples derived from a custom motor testing apparatus that measured motor PWM frequency response spectrum. The MotorKit library was modified to permit adjustment of PWM frequency as well.
* After the all-too-long distraction into DC motors, it’s time to take stock and reprioritize the stack of unloved projects, unless these two Picos manage to squirm to the top. Oh yeah, after I look into submitting a PR to add UV Index and Lux getters to the LTR-390UV sensor library.
* Unrelated: Took on a challenge to illustrate a book of poetry for young adults. I’m not an artist, so this is definitely out of my comfort zone. Lesson learned: hide your doodles.


@charlesburnaford (lurking)


52:01 @danh

* Trying to improve the displayio.Group by making it use a List internally. 


54:50 @foamyguy
* Last Week
   * Merged base_alignment PRs in display_text
   * Reviewing and testing ProgressBar and Displayio_Layout PRs
   * Learned how to “install” pre-commit to make it automatically integrated with git
   * Successfully sent / received msgpack’d data over LoRa RFM Radios
* Next Week
   * Begin working inside the learn system on a new guide covering display_text more comprehensively than existing pages.
   * Make a PR for LinearLayout the displayio_layout library
   * Get out my matrix portal for progress bar testing.
   * Test the tab issue fix PR in display_text


57:37 @hierophect
* Last week:
   * Hacked at the I2C problems on ESP32S2 with GDB a bit, got some decent test results but no substantial progress.
   * Low power on the STM32
   * Extracted out EXTI into a new module and made sure that it didn’t break PulseIn
   * Finished PinAlarm
* This week:
   * More low power stuff, TimeAlarm, etc
   * The extraction of the EXTI and RTC system means that the RTC and RotaryIO modules might be low hanging fruit.




59:57 @Hugo (will miss, work meeting)
* Last week:
   * Got 98% through the progress vertical progress bar updates
   * Fixed issues and suggestions from other PB issues into the current one
   * Started working on moving Pylint to pre-commit
* This week:
   * Wrap up progress bar refactor & vertical
   * Make sure examples still work as expected on devices (not just Blinka-on-computer ones)
   * Work on Cookiecutter to incorporate Pylint
      * Include documentation of changes for changes to apply to existing libraries
   * Add support for anchoring in ProgressBar
   * Might take a detour from the progress bar and work issues on other libraries (open to suggestions and/or requests)

* We’ve had several contributions of ideas and PRs about changes and fixes to the CircuitPython mode over in the Mu editor repository (see: https://github.com/mu-editor/mu/pull/485#issuecomment-782879502 for a summary). I’d like to raise this here simply so folks have a) visibility of this discussion, and b) feel invited/empowered to take part in it. I’d feel gutted if folks felt left out. Our aim: reach consensus among folks about what, if anything, could/should change in the CircuitPython mode. That’s it..!

1:01:12 @Hugo (will miss, work meeting - if @foamyguy is around, can expand on it)
* To keep full backward compatibility with the currently published version of adafruit_circuitpython_progressbar, @foamyguy found that we can add an import statement at the bottom of the __init__.py. This has the immense benefit of keeping all the examples, samples and learn guides as-is. However, we don’t know if adding that import would have any negative impact on memory usage.


1:05:44 @Jose David (missing meeting)
* Related to a lot of discussions in discord and the work in the new progress bar, I saw that there is a function to transpose xy the tile as a bitmap. I am wondering if we can apply the same to a character (glyph) and have vertical text. Ie for the progress bar or labels. Any insight is appreciated

1:09:02 @Mark(Gamblor)
I may be missing due to work if so I’ll ping someone on discord later. If I’m around it will likely be after 2pm CST.
* Looked at countio for RP2040. The PWM counter wraps at 65536 so unless the user is actively reading it, it would be very easy to wrap and have no indication. My thought is to use a background process in the port_background to just read/update this if it is active. Just making sure that sounds correct.


1:12:33 @TG-Techie: 
* There is still an issue with the lc709203f driver where the chip occasionally doesn’t respond to queries but sends “all 0s” (which appears as crc errors).  The chip does support clock stretching. Has anybody seen similar issues with I2C chips?

* Multiple inheritance from native base classes.
