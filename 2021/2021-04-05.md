* Majority of my time last week was spent on PWM iMX, pretty good shape now and is available in main. Check it out, leave us issues for any bugs.
* Other stuff: timings of these new ways of accessing bitmap data, the exciting thing is that we’ve talked about improving the capabilities of CP, and with these changes, on nRF, we can keep up with the incoming audio data, to sample in the background.
* Encoders on RP2040
* Updated ulab to the newest version in CP7
   * This is a breaking change, all software using ulab will need to be updated
   * Guide will be updated closer to release of 7
* This week: I2S out on rt1011 microcontroller. Would like to improve ulab docs, and whatever else comes along, including wrapping up PRs.
* Missed the meeting last week to get COVID vaccination. Encourage all to get one.


26:39 @Jose David: (text only)

* Anyone done generative LED animations? 1-4 byte number -> short unique animation? Will be useful for discovery and pairing over BLE.
* Presenting on Friday morning at the Open Hardware Summit.


36:13 @askpatrickw 
* [Azure IoT Cpython Sockets Support :: #24](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_AzureIoT/issues/24). I’m still slowly whittling away at this. First I wanted to see it work via esp32spi WIFI. And that did require changes.  It is working with IoT Hub, but not with IoT Central. I’m sort of stuck there and digging through why that might be. Next step is working with the native wifi (esp32-s2). All of this is occurring slowly in my free-time. 
* [ESP-IDF v4.3 #4182](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/4182) : Any news or asks from the community on this?


37:47 @danh
* Released 6.2.0-rc.0. One important and simple fix for MacOS Mouse HID since then. May just make it 6.2.0 final instead of doing rc.1.
* Fixed release creation issues when doing 6.2.0-rc.0.
* Turn off USB Remote Wakeup in our USB descriptor. This was an issue for MicroPython; it affected us less but was still important to incorporate. Good to track MicroPython changes.
* Proposed an idea to be able to treat an interrupt as a Python exception. @WarriorOfWire pointed out that this was a bad idea in several respects, but it provoked a good discussion over the weekend.


40:34 @David.Glaude: (text only)
* Trying Blinka on a Pi Zero (and see if my CP code work there)
* Testing LedShim code on Pi Zero with Blinka and Feather RP 2040
* Trying to find a uniform naming for Pi Zero like 20x2 pinout (see “in the weed”)
* Trying to figure out what are the difference and when to use “adafruit_st7789.ST7789” or “adafruit_rgb_display.st7789” (see “in the weed”)


41:?? @deshipu (text)
* I’m doing research for making another hand-held game console, this time with a 3.2” screen and hopefully much better sound and controls. Still struggling with some decisions and some experiments that need to be done.
* Fluff Micro, a Fluff M0 in an Arduino Pro Micro form factor, for easy replacement in projects.
* Some progress on the MIDI ocarina.


41:38 @foamyguy

* This week
   * Incorporate PR feedback
   * Look around for other issues with hardware which I can help with
   * Found out that remapping “CAPS LOCK” to F24 in Windows, and using that for PTT in Discord surprisingly works!


## 45:53 In The Weeds


46:08 @askpatrickw 
[How to handle Dependencies that are not published on PyPi :: Circup #96](https://github.com/adafruit/circup/issues/96)
Specifying CircuitPython Requirements vs CPython requirements which include CP Libraries
1. Adding non-pypi published libraries to requirements.txt breaks builds
   * env-requirements.txt as an approach
   * Suggested: circuitpython-requirements.txt and requirements.txt
2. JSON AND\OR requirements.txt
   * Would third-party bundles also have to implement JSON? 
   * Is this a standard that is intended to be established?
   * Should circup switch to the JSON and if so, should we remove the requirements.txt from the bundles?
Conclusion:
* CircuitPython only requirements which are in addition to those in requirements.txt will be documented in a circuitpython-requirements.json -- @MakerMelissa will decide the filename\format.
* Yes. Circup will move to the JSON files in the bundles.
* Yes. It is planned that in the future where there are 3-rd party bundles they’d be built the same way.




1:02:43 @David.Glaude (maybe text-only, will try to have microphone an quiet place)
1. What are the differences between those two way to access a 240x240 screen (is there an old and a new library? One to use with Blinka and the other for CP? Are there benefit or one or the other):
   * “adafruit_st7789.ST7789”
   * “adafruit_rgb_display.st7789”


2. Proposal: Unified pin numbering for Blinka on 2x20 socket (aka Pi like).


I would like to be able to use the same code on SBC and MCU that communicate with a Bonnet/pHAT/HAT.


When I say "MCU" it could be a CircuitPython board with an adaptor to have Raspberry Pi pinout :
* if Feather format with the FeatherCap v0.2 of @unfinishedstuff => https://github.com/UnfinishedStuff/FeatherCap
* in micro:bit format with the Bit:2:Pi from @4tronix_uk => https://4tronix.co.uk/blog/?p=1568


Mostly I am interested in the Raspberry Pi family, but I am Ok with using it on Banana, Google Coral, Jetson, Pin, Orange, or other fruit with a 2x20 connector.


I wanted to see what was available on the Raspbery Pi Zero+ and it is the BMC numbering in use, using Dxx for GPIOxx (with no alias except for SPI/I2C/UART/...)


There are two problems with this:
* It does not respect the silk numbering (that is the physical pin number)
* It use Dxx so this "conflict" with Dxx used on Feather


At least one board use for some pin a physical numbering alias in the form of GPIO_Pxx.


So I would like to have a possibly for all board with a compatible 2x20 pin to have such an alias (see https://gist.github.com/dglaude/8a683ae5409970cb4e58a8668eb462e1 for full list):
* GPIO_P3 = D2
* GPIO_P5 = D3
* GPIO_P7 = D4


Then for adapter, I could write a little mapping/alias library.


1:15:50 @Jose David: (Text Only)
Issue #4516 I saw some discussion regarding the size of the lists. Is there any guideline on how much data can we put in a list? Why this limit is higher for dictionaries, I have used dictionaries with >2000 entries.  3 items for each entry, all ints.


Second topic: Now that  we are moving some widgets out of the Displayio layout library, could we add more features? Widgets were in the light side because they were in the displayio layout library?


1:21:16 @danh
* Please think about your use cases for interrupts and comment in issue #4542.


1:25:41 @kattni
* Do we want this to be a page in the Welcome to CP guide, or do we think it has enough content for its own guide or is likely to be expanded on and therefore would benefit from being its own guide? https://github.com/kmatch98/CircuitPython_memory_saving/
* Guide!


## 1:28:49 Wrap-Up
