### Where should CircuitPython go in 2021?
As 2021 starts, let’s take some time to share our goals for CircuitPython in 2021. Just like past years (full summary 2019 and 2020), we’d like everyone in the CircuitPython community to contribute by posting their thoughts to some public place on the Internet.
Here are a few ways to post: a video on YouTube, a post on the CircuitPython forum, a blog post on your site, a series of Tweets, a Gist on GitHub, or a /r/CircuitPython subreddit post.
We want to hear from you. When you post, please add #CircuitPython2021 and email circuitpython2021@adafruit.com to let us know about your post so we can blog it up here.
### Espressif Systems Announces the ESP32-S3 Microcontroller
The ESP32-S3 features a dual-core LX7 32-bit processor operating up to 240 MHz. (The previous -S2 was single-core.) On-chip is 512 KB of SRAM and 384 KB of RAM with support for octal SPI to connect to external memory devices. The RF capabilities include WiFi 2.4 GHz b/g/n, legacy Bluetooth, and Bluetooth Low-Energy 5.0. Artificial Intelligence applications can take advantage of the ESP32-S3's vector instructions in the MCU. These provide acceleration for neural networks and signal processing loads.
For peripherals, the ESP32-S3 supports up to 44 programmable GPIOs for GPIOs, SPI, I2S, I2C, PWM, RMT, ADC, DAC, UART, SD/MMC host, and TWAI.

@cater (lurking)


@CGrover (just listening)


@charlesburnaford (lurking)


38:28 @danh
* Released CircuitPython 6.0.1, fixing BLE and FrequencyIn regressions, and adding JSON speedup.
* Debugging and fixing various issues for eventual 6.1.0 release. This work continues.
* Will be looking at adding a secondary USB serial channel so you can use a serial connection over USB to communicate without interfering with the REPL.


41:36 @David.Glaude (lurking)
* Enviro+ FeatherWing:
   * Adding FeatherS2 support in pimoroni/physical_feather_pins
   * Comparing temperature from on board bme280 vs Stemma pct2075
* Bluepad32 (AirLift replacement firmware to communicate with Bluetooth joystick):
   * Install on MatrixPortal M4, try “draw” and play two player “snake” with WiiMote
   * Install on PyPortal and try to find a project that could use a joystick
* PyPortal:
   * Switching I2C from 5V to 3V to use the Stemma connector.
   * IN/OUT temperature sensor: https://twitter.com/DavidGlaude/status/1344682774335270912
* Non CP:
   * Blink and listen to button of a “Buzz! Controller” on Raspberry Pi (I am interested in a CP way to do that, but it requires USB Host.


@deshipu (lurking)


42:48 @foamyguy
* Time off
   * Playing stardew valley. Brainstorming ways to use Circuit Python devices with it. Perhaps a birthday / special event calendar on PyPortal or MagTag
   * Planning ideas for some new Tilemap games. Looking through assets that I have available 
   * MagTag “patchwork” pattern generator using some of the assets in one of the game bundles
   * Hunting a strange issue with extra scaling of Groups in some cases in Blinka_Displayio
* This week
   * Finish porting the IOT Trivia app to PyPortal
   * Update BitmapLabel to match support for ascender / descender properties 
   * Add some additional options to the display frame widget I created
   * Write a yearly Circuit Python thoughts post


47:45 @hierophect
* Last week:
   * Worked on flashcard guide
   * Tried some socket fixes
   * Took time off for the holidays
   * Built a big flashcard system on PC, might design a device for it
* This week:
   * Figure out blocking problems in Socket
   * Start on I2C bugs
   * Get back into i.MX weeds


@hugo (lurking)


@jasonp (lurking)


23:31 @jepler
* Last weeks:
   * Didn’t spend much time working, between family happenings and the holidays
   * Created a web-based bdf→pcf converter.  Hosted on github pages, works client side, which is neat.  http://www.unpythonic.net/web-bdftopcf/  https://github.com/jepler/web-bdftopcf
   * Released 6.1.0-beta.3, thanks all who contributed!
* This week:
   * I2S on esp32s2
   * More font-related stuff if time allows


25:48 @jerryn
* Last weeks
   * Implemented some updates to RFM9x library to fix rssi calculation and implement some datasheet errata fixes reported by @maholli
   * Helped a discord user with QTPy Haxpress - they needed audiobusio in order to use an i2s amplifier.
      * Swapped vectorio for audiobusio and gave them a custom build that works with i2s.
      * Hopefully the user can now build their own custom version.
   * Trying to use deep sleep on esp32s2 to wake up and send data to AIO
      * Had some issues but most seem to be fixed by catching network connection issues.  Still a WIP but metros2 survived an overnight run for the first time.
      * Had one case while on USB when umfeathers2 “woke up” but went to safe mode.
         * The Status LED made it much easier to troubleshoot on the metros2. Working on implementing it for the umfeathers2.
* Next week
   * Testing implementation of the Status LED for the umfeathers2.
      * Status seems to be working but have run into some issues that appear to be pre-existing regarding the dotstar operation and interaction with the LDO2 pin.  Hope to have a PR ready soon.
      * Plan to use an RFM9x featherwing with either umfeathers2 or metros2 with deep sleep to see how they work together. No problem using rfm9x with the esp32s2 boards. Just want to see if deep sleep can be used with it.


30:13 @kattni
* Last two weeks:
   * Set up Membership Screening on Discord
   * Helped write up guide for LTR390
   * Wrote up guide for MPR121 Gator breakout board
   * Mostly updated CCS811 guide with STEMMA QT revision of board
      * Overview not completed - waiting on board to go live in shop
* This week:
   * Get CircuitPython build environment updated - won the battle with gcc on MacOS!
   * Reorganise the asset folders on Python on Hardware newsletter to wrap up 2020
   * Go through guide feedback
      * Added blink example for QT Py to alleviate folks’ frustration as per guide feedback.
   * Test Circuit Playground PR.
   * Finish CCS811 guide.
   * CircuitPython 2021 post.
   * Library PR/Issue sweep
* My own projects:
   * Started looking at beginning the code to port my tabletop lightbox photo studio from Python on RPi to CircuitPython - the CP version can’t be based on the keyboard controlled Python version as I’m including a miniTFT FeatherWing and Bluetooth support in the CP version, along with compensation for and separate control of the warm and cool LEDs (original version was cool).


35:52 @Kevin Thomas (lurking, text only)
* Focused on teaching a number of different courses such as Ansible For Everyone, MicroPython For micro:bit and Reverse Engineering For Everyone! so hopefully very soon will start making some more CircuitPython projects.


36:18 @MakerMelissa
* Last 2 weeks:
   * Refactored MatrixPortal to use PortalBase
   * Worked on refactoring PyPortal over to use PortalBase.
   * Worked on some NeoPixel issues on Raspberry Pi
   * Took most of that time off
* This Week:
   * Catching up on issues and PRs from while I was gone


36:45 @Mark[Gamblor] (lurking)
* Hope to get a PR for the fixed adafruit_busdevice in the core out this week. May need help to test it to avoid any of the previous issues that were caught.


37:00 @Mr. Certainly (text only)
* Picked up an Analog & Digital Discovery, learning the tools for future projects.
* During a snowstorm power outage, we did small engine repairs on two generators -- one had a bad float which couldn’t be fixed immediately, the other had a blocked fuel line. Always fun putting troubleshooting skills to work….outside, at 4am, while sleeting.
* Fixed a drain pipe leak, which created a small waterfall in our basement. Good news -- I have some water-damaged NES & SNES systems and carts to practice electronics repair (or vintage system cases for other projects).


38:09 @tannewt (Out on vacation, back Tuesday)
* #circuitpython2021 blogging
* Streaming on Friday
* Catching up on emails and PRs
* Other odds and ends


## 49:39 In The Weeds
@danh (already discussed in Status):
* Request: Anyone with a 2018 MacBook Pro (and maybe later), take a look at https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/3918 and see if you can reproduce the problem with the simple blink program in that issue.


49:59 @kattni - Mention the CP 2021 call again.


## 54:06 Wrap-Up
