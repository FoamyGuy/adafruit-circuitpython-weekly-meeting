## 24:10 Hug reports


24:10 @danh
* Thanks to @jepler for some temporary fixes to the CPy builds that we reverted after the underlying problems were fixed.
* Group hug to the entire community for a wonderful year of projects, community support, and contributions.


25:?? @CGrover (text only) 
* @jepler for his insightful RPN calculator guide. It provided me with a needed leg up on one of my current projects. The guide is also an excellent coding style example. Decimal objects are amazingly cool and could help with some other projects.
* Reflecting on all of this year’s projects and progress. Can’t thank the community enough for the unselfish and exceptionally positive support to fuel my personal development and growth. 


26:10 @foamyguy
* Group hug, looking forward to another great year with this project and community.
* @dexter starboard for sharing many displayio examples on discord. Including new GlyphWidget
* @Cgrover for sharing a matrix portal snowman script
* @ntoll and team working on Mu for releasing a new version


26:55 @jepler
* @danh for release candidate
* @foamyguy for friday streams
* Blush at @cgrover for the kind remarks about my code
* Everyone who used & contributed to CircuitPython in 2021


27:30 @jerryn
* @tannewt for patiently helping me get started with the broadcom builds.
* Group Hug – Best wishes for 2022!


27:55 @kattni

* @foamyguy for continuing to get through older PRs
* @mark [gamblor] for taking an interest in getting the IS31 going more smoothly in CP
* @cater for all his help throughout the year with guide questions
* @kevin at Digi-Key for sending me some purple LEDs and some excellent Digi-Key swag.
* Everyone who has been there for me throughout the last year
* Group hug to all involved in CircuitPython and this community, you make it what it is. I hope everyone had a wonderful holiday (or last week if it’s not your thing) and that everyone has a lovely new year!


30:15 @kmatch (text only)
* As the days start to get longer, it’s a good time of year to count blessings, just wanted to express my gratitude to Adafruit and the CircuitPython development team and extended CP library developer/sample code community. While software and hardware sometimes are solitary activities, it’s always nice to connect with kind and welcoming folks willing to lend a hand. That makes each of us better and helps us all grow. Many thanks y’all! 


30:55 @Mark(gamblor) [lurking]
* Digikey for randomly picking me a winner for their #DigiWish contest
* Group hug to everyone, stay healthy and have a great new year!


31:15 @microdev (lurking)
* Group hug to the entire CircuitPython community for awesome projects, contributions and support throughout the year.
* Wishing everyone a very Happy New Year!


31:30 @tekktrik (not present)
* @foamyguy for all their help with the typing PRs and FRAM library work
* @foamyguy and @PaulskPt for help me get a quick fix through for an issue in the Display_Text library
* @jepler for starting on making a Font typing Protocol that will make the typing easier for end users to understand
* @danh for always answering my random questions on Discord and GitHub so I'm never stalled
* @kattni for checking in about letting me help out with some infrastructure stuff that I'm interested in and helping to make a welcoming community
* Group hug, happy new year!
## 32:10 Status Updates


@danh
* Fixed `alarm.wake_alarm` not being set properly, a regression that we considered the last serious bug to fix for 7.1.0 final. There are still a number of 7.x.x issues, most of which we would hope to address in versions after 7.1.0.
* Released two release candidates, 7.1.0-rc.0 and 7.1.0-rc.1, on Dec 23 and Dec 25, respectively. rc.1 enables I2C power on the QT Py ESP32-S2 by default (courtesy @ladyada). We’re not sure when we’ll release 7.1.0 final, but if no show-stopper issues arise, it could be early next week or perhaps even earlier.


33:45 @CGrover (text only)
* Continuing work on the RPN calculator with a few distractions into retro widget, displayio internals, food and family, and a wonderful shift to cool, crisp weather.


34:00 @foamyguy
        Last week
* PyPortal busy simulator code mostly done and working. Will be making the guide for it this week.
* Friday stream had fun making some festive designs with vectorio on a PyPortal
* Continuing to work through open PRs. Got some HT16K33 featherwings assembled for a few PRs in that library.
        This week
* Attempt to tackle some open issues in the core related to displayio to get some more practice inside core.
* Stream again Friday night


35:10 @jepler
* Last week: 
   * Lots of stuff with CI / github actions needing groomed, like a well-kept lawn
   * Finished my lamp project
* This week:
   * Make a guide for my lamp project
   * Out the latter part of the week
* Happy New Year!


36:08 @jerryn
* Finally got my CM4(io) configured so I can boot from the network and use an SDCard just for the file system. Still can’t get it to boot from USB…
   * Play around with Pi4 build as well – it boots fine from USB and used the SDCard for its file system.
   * Now just need to remember how to use gdb and try to be helpful….
* Spent a lot of time on some non  CP projects - mostly in response to forum or Discord questions. Unfortunately, most of the help was “it works for me” but I learned and relearned a lot in the process. I learn so much from monitoring the forums and Discord!
* Wow the QTPy ES32S2 is a nice package! So easy to connect a sensor and be up and running.


38:20 @kattni
* Last week
   * Got the absolute basic pages done for QT Py ESP, which was made live
   * NOTHING.
* This week
   * NOTHING.


39:30 @mark(gamblor) [lurking]
* One more test I want to run on the IS31FL3741 speed and need to write a summary of how it all works together. May be after the new year.
* Booster shot tomorrow!


40:05 @tekktrik (text)
* After the holidays:
   * More typing PRs, going for some more challenging libraries
   * Add a way for seven segment displays to marquee and/or print a variety of characters beyond setting segments individually
   * Work on getting tap detection working on LSM6DS library
