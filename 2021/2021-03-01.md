### 3:13 70 Single Board Computers now support CircuitPython!

Blinka brings CircuitPython APIs and CircuitPython libraries to single board computers (SBCs). It is a pip installable Python library that runs in normal "desktop" Python. One can port their microcontroller code to an SBC or visa versa!

Blinka reached a milestone this week - it now supports 70 different single board computers! - CircuitPython.Org.

### 3:45 CircuitPython Subreddit reaches 2,000 members!

The CircuitPython subreddit on Reddit.com crossed the 2,000 members mark! Thank you to our Reddit readers for choosing to get your Python fix on our subreddit - Blog post.

### 4:09 Python Developers Survey 2020 Results

The Python Software Foundation are excited to share the results of the fourth official Python Developers Survey conducted with the help of JetBrains. More than 28,000 Python users from almost 200 countries took part in the survey this past October. With the help of the data collected, they are able to present the summarized results, identify the latest trends, and create a Python developer profile. - Python Software Foundation and JetBrains.

### 4:46 Raspberry Pi turns 9!

The original Raspberry Pi launched on Feburary 29th, 2012, making this low cost single board computer nine years old. It really doesn't seem that long ago. With 38 million units sold, the Raspberry Pi powers a huge community of makers, students and businesses. What started as a small project, meant to increase applications for Cambridge University’s computer science program, has become a global movement - Tom's Hardware.

Overall, 6.2 is rapidly approaching, a lot of good stuff for RP2040 and reliability stuff for S2 that’s in that.  It’s _likely_ to be the last subrelease of 6 and we’ll probably switch to developing 7.0 at that point, making those incompatible changes at that time.

We have a situation where pylint was updated, and a previously existing check for duplicate code that wasn’t active started working.  The way we do examples in our libraries, we have many examples with similar code, because the imports and setup are often the same even though the rest of the code is completely different. We want to have this check active on library code but not example code. We have pylint running in the way we need, but we are waiting for that to be applied to all of the libraries.  For those who are submitting PRs that are failing on parts of the code you didn’t touch, please don’t sweat it. If you feel up to it, we can help you through the steps to make this change so your PR can go through soon, or you can just wait. Let us know.  Thanks for all the contributions and progress on the libraries!

@charlesburnaford (lurking)


36:09 @danh
* Debugging RP2040 I2C issues with a particular sensor, the TCS34725. No obvious reason why it’s not working: looked at timing, analog waveforms, etc. On some I2C writes, it NACKS instead of ACKing. It does work on bitbangio.I2C.
* Thought about and wrote up various strawman ideas for speeding up translation builds.
* Will start on beta.3 release notes.
* Will be the nth person to work on ESP32-S2 I2C issues.

58:30 @MakerMelissa
* Last Week:
   * Spent a good chunk of the week hacking on the Mini PiTFT Display Driver so that a single driver would work on each of the 3 ST7789 displays along with rotation and offsets
   * Updated the PiTFT script to be much more flexible with different rotation settings with different displays using the power of Python.
   * Implemented the offset logic into our Arduino library which makes it much cleaner to work with
   * Updated the Raspberry Pi Fan service script to make use of the built-in fan service
   * Update the circuitpython.org website with more blinka boards bringing us up to 70
   * Started diving into the conflict between the BrainCraft Audio driver and the BrainCraft Display
* This Week:
   * Continue looking into Audio conflicts and hopefully solve it
   * Look into the Memory issues on PortalBase with the MatrixPortal
   * Update libgpiod_pulsein on Blinka to load 32 or 64 bit version depending on Raspberry Pi OS version
   * Add MatrixPortal display rotation option
   * Add MagTag WiFi enable option

* Integrated optional switching regulator into final rev of TG-Watch
* Aligned screw holes with the reset button on the watch to remove an entry pointer for water
  Next week:
* Test if the lsm6dso library is compatible with the lsm6dsox IC
* Bring the prototypes up to parody with the rev04 TG-Watch
* Test gasket maker with grey watch body
* Some internal restructuring to optimize for memory in the TG-Gui Api

* Last couple of weeks continued work on microlab:
   * Fixed a number of smaller bugs
   * Added a couple of new functions, sorted out endianness problem
   * Experimented with a new extension module allowing lazy loading vast amounts of data that don’t even fit into RAM.
* Coming weeks:
   * Trying to finish the extension module. Once done, rolling out version 3.0

1:01:07 @jepler, @danh
* Goal: reduce CI build times
* Don’t build the “pirate” translation[a]
* Don’t build “almost empty and unmaintained” translations[b]
   * If a translation is seeing real activity, even if it is not substantially complete, we want to build it
   * This list would be hand-maintained
   * This would likely exclude: Hindi (0 translations), Greek (0 translations), Czech (3% translated), Korean (7% translated)
* @jepler will file a PR so that there’s an allow-list of translations to be built, excluding Hindi, Greek, Czech, Korean initially. We’ll leave pirate for now.
* @tannewt will write a policy showing new translations where to start, and what the bar is for inclusion

How does the garbage collector deal with circularly referenced objects?
```
typedef struct _B_obj_t {
        mp_obj_base_t base;
        void *a;
} B_obj_t;


typedef struct _A_obj_t {
        mp_obj_base_t base;
        B_obj_t *b;
} A_obj_t;


B_obj_t *b = m_new_obj(B_obj_t);
A_obj_t *a = m_new_obj(A_obj_t);
b->a = a;
```
        @jepler - mark & sweep garbage collection handles circular references without difficulty https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracing_garbage_collection#Na%C3%AFve_mark-and-sweep


@v923z Is it what is implemented in micro/circuitpython? @danh - yes


1:22:00 @David.Glaude:[c]
There are currently 3 boards that want to map RP2040 or PICO to Zero Raspberry Pi:
* “Pico to Zero Adaptor” by RED ROBOTICS: https://twitter.com/NeilRedRobotics/status/1361640950276247553?s=20
* Pico Zero rev A by Limor: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKSYct1S34U&t=57
* Meta Pico by @arturo182: https://twitter.com/arturo182/status/1358096187715432450?s=20
Only the first one is an available product (from the make in UK via Tindie). So I plan to test and write demo code for some of my pHAT/HAT but now I have a problem:
1. Do I want to use PICO pin name (current solution) or can the RED Robotics have a board definition? If having a definition, car it be “exactly the same” as on a Pi Zero running Blinka (same physical position = same name).
2. There is strong possibility that Arturo and Limor will/do not use the same pinout and there might be 3 differents mapping. => How to avoid this so that my example work on those 3 boards without modification?
3. If (1 or 2) is not possible/desirable, how could I build an intermediate layer between “board.*”? ”import myboard as board” or something like that.


1:27:20 @Hugo
* About the PyLint update, we may need to have a quick guide on updating the local/PR branch with the check, since the GitHub action will run on the code “as-is”, not “as it would be merged”
   * @kattni This is something we’ll want to work with folks on individually. In terms of a “guide”, we could write something up in a Gist (Markdown) or a Google doc so we have a document to point folx to. Is that something you’re interested in doing?
   * @hugo  I can certainly write that up for a “Here’s how you do it for now” guide-as-a-gist
