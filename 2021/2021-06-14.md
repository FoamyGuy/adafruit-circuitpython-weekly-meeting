###  Tom's Hardware Best RP2040 Boards 2021
 Best RP2040 Boards 

While Raspberry Pi has its own RP2040-powered board in the Raspberry Pi Pico, there are now more than a dozen, third-party solutions that offer improvements which range from smaller sizes to built-in Wi-Fi, more storage or a lot of additional outputs. There are even RP2040-powered keypads.
To help you choose, we‚Äôve listed the best RP2040 boards below. These boards can be used for everything from general learning to building Wi-Fi connected robots to implementing basic A.I.
Adafruit has three of the 10 boards! - Tom's Hardware.

### 3:45 2021 - The Year Windows Became a First Class Python Development Environment
 Windows Powershell 

I felt so badly burned by Apple‚Äôs laptop hardware design decisions of a few years ago that I‚Äôve rather fallen out of love with that platform for my personal work. My first choice was the Linux desktop, and after months of struggling, instability and accessibility issues I‚Äôll admit I‚Äôve been looking for stable, solid alternatives that are also powerful enough to get the job done and maybe even have something new to offer... If you‚Äôve tangoed with Windows in the past, and found yourself struggling against its rather byzantine UI, I‚Äôd urge you to read on and see if maybe it‚Äôs not time for another careful look.

  * 5 issues not assigned a milestone


Overall: The 6.3.0 release continues to be stable, though we have 3 open issues we‚Äôd like to resolve in a future bug-fix release such as 6.3.1.


Most of our work is in the main branch, which will become 7.0.  There‚Äôs not a specific schedule. Instead, we‚Äôre working on issues tagged ‚Äú7.0.0‚Äù and as that number decreases we‚Äôll move towards beta release.  Think months, not weeks.


The recent improvement on the main branch I‚Äôm most excited about is that you can now run a command to install the ‚Äúcircuitpython stubs‚Äù locally (`make stubs && pip install .`), so that advanced source code editors such as pycharm can help diagnose mistakes like calling functions without the right number of arguments, before even running the code. Early hug report to @foamyguy for laying the groundwork for this in `setup.py`.

Overall: We‚Äôve moved all of the CircuitPython libraries to the `main` default branch. Early hug report to Dylan for all the amazing work there, and early hug report to Justin for creating a tool that made updating Learn super simple. We‚Äôre continuing to get through older PRs - Jose David has done up a report that covers the rest of the open PRs, and suggestions on what to do (we‚Äôll discuss this more In the Weeds). I‚Äôm really happy to see us getting caught up on library PRs, and continuing to stay caught up on recent ones. Thanks again to everyone who contributes and to those contributing their own libraries to the Community Bundle.

22:40 @kattni
* Last week:
   * Updated circuitpython.org/libraries to have the 7.x bundle.
   * Updated the README for the Project Bundler to reflect the two version folders within the zip
   * Updated the Adafruit Community CoC.
   * Created a PR to generate a CircuitPython Community CoC for community libraries.
   * Added a CP NeoPixel example to the Rotary QT guide (it was not intuitive to use)
   * Templated the Feather RP2040 CircuitPython install page
   * Incidentally testing the ‚Äúreplace page‚Äù feature in Learn for the first time (spoiler: it worked! Well, mostly‚Ä¶)
   * Fixed a couple of misc.
   * Added a section on using safe mode in CircuitPython to the RP2040 install page template (so it‚Äôs in all of the RP2040 board guides)
   * Started the Slider Trinkey guide
   * Updated the Git and GitHub guide to include a section on deleting your fork and your local clone, and forking again and cloning locally again. This is the simplest way to update your setup to use the `main` default branch if you had previously forked and cloned a repo that was updated.
* This week:
   * Finish Slider Trinkey guide
   * Test pypixebuf PR on 6.x and 7.x
   * Start the QTRP2040 Trinkey guide
      * Including using the NeoPixel and the button in CircuitPython
      * And a page using the QT Trinkey with U2IF that turns it into a Blinka-compatible USB adapter
   * Create I2C CircuitPython template (to go into QT Trinkey guide)
* This evening:
   * Getting my second COVID vaccine! (So no idea how this week will end up looking.)


27:15 @kingernorth (text only)
* Last couple of weeks
   * I‚Äôve been working on a new course proposal with the local college through a program set up by the Ministry of Colleges and Universities in Ontario for grant money. This is a new program of Micro-credentials. My proposal has advanced and has been officially submitted to the college and the Ontario government. This course I‚Äôve created is Microcontrollers for Commercial Applications. This course is using both CircuitPython and Arduino. 
* This week 
   * I just built a 3x3x3 led cube, which I‚Äôve never built one before, and I‚Äôll be writing code and testing using it with CircuitPython on a couple of RP2040 boards, feather and pico, that I have.
   * I also purchased my first Raspberry Pi, a Pi400 and I‚Äôm starting to use it with both a monitor and Cyberdeck/TFT. New adventures.


28:05 @MakerMelissa
* Last Week:
   * Finished up Voice2JSON guide
   * Updated EPD Guide with new 2.13‚Äù E-Ink Display
   * Tested a fixed SDL Script and updated the PiTFT guides
   * Moved a number of Blinka and Raspberry Pi related repos from Master to Main
   * Went through and fixed a handful of repos that were not passing their checks
* This Week:
   * Finish up fixing repos
   * Test out using Python Extended Bus on Raspberry Pi with multiple SPI devices
   * Take a look at an outstanding PR on the WebSerial ESPTool
   * Start working on a Microsoft Lobe guide


29:15 @Mark(Gamblor) [lurking and may not be present]
* Looking more into the ESP32S2 display glitches now that I have a logic analyzer. I can‚Äôt make in the weeds this week but there seems to be an occasional delay in the row/column commands to the display causing an issue. I‚Äôll keep looking.


29:39 @CGrover
* Published the nuevo thermal camera learning guide, so it‚Äôs time to pull out a couple projects that need upgrades and fixes. 
   * To extend its life, the robotic heirloom cuckoo clock project is now augmented with electronic sounds as a backup for the servo actuators. After 50+ years of operation, the original mechanical whistles are showing irreversible wear. In the recording studio today getting some high resolution tracks of the original mechanical whistles and gongs to replace the stock sound effect samples.
   * To reduce the kludge of breakout boards and wires (and to obtain another OSHPark sticker), designing a dual INA260 + DRV8833 custom FeatherWing PCB for the motor tester appliance.


31:15 @danh
* Rewrote keypad scanner several times to zero in on the best and simplest API. Finishing key-per-pin and will do key matrix next.


32:47 @david.glaude (lurking)
* Dynamic Emoji in Discord by editing previous comment and changing the previous emoji: https://gist.github.com/dglaude/ef09681965d3bb11c9fc3b2b6ad478e3 Demo done during my Hug report...


33:10 @foamyguy
* Last week
   * Rotary Trinkey brightness crank code
   * Began work in imageload library to allow it to work with file-like objects like BytesIO
   * Remove a workaround in imageload library no longer needed
* This week
   * Design and print Rotary Trinkey crank case
   * Learn about PyPi versioning to try to figure out how to set up seperate ‚Äòstable‚Äô and ‚Äòlatest‚Äô  releases for the stubs


35:05 @hierophect
* Last week:
   * Wrote up the learn documentation for Alarm and the light/deep sleep implementations across the other ports it now exists on
   * Got started merging in code for supervisor set-next-file
   * Planned out some of the difficulties this runs into as it relates to sleep, since the filename needs to persist across deep sleep, which is similar to a reset
* This week:
   * Wrap up an initial implementation for next-file that simply avoids any interaction with deep sleep
   * Fill out some related sleep features, like sleep memory on the STM32 and RP2040
   * Articulate problem on github for input


36:45 @jepler
* Last week:
   * Finally got ov7670 camera working on esp32s2!  Pull request is in but not merged
   * It means incompatible changes in the ParallelImageCapture class, which will be fixed in adafruit_ov7670 library
   * Added a board definition for the ‚Äúv1.3‚Äù kaluga board
   * Tracked down and fixed some other fun stuff
   * Helped out with setup.py to install stubs
* This week:
   * Back to ov2640 initialization code, moving over to rp2040 due to some glitches on samd51.
   * Also discovered that i2c speeds below 100kHz don‚Äôt actually go to lower rates on samd51, no idea why.
   * Would like to update my keyboard to 7.0-pre to get the ability to shut off the repl, but also need to contrive access to its reset button before doing that
   * Would also like to look into some apparent problems with the ulab stubs (stubs have names like ulab.ndarray, not ulab.numpy.ndarray, for instance)


39:39 @jerryn
* Played with OV7670 on a Kaluga esp32s2. Learned a lot about the displayio init sequence for the ili9341 -- always nice to demystify something.  
   * The examples from @jepler were very educational.
* Chasing down some issues with sdioio on the stm32f405
   * Getting intermittent I/O errors on writes
   * Working on a minimal case showing the problem -- will open an issue
   * Same code runs fine on feather M4 with sdcardio or M0 with sdcard
* Stumbled across issue with print in CircuitPython
   * On some builds , print will throw an error if the ‚Äúflush‚Äù keyword is used.
      * So far, fails on M4,nrf52840,esp32s2,stm32f405... works on M0
      * Issue opened.
* Out next week -- Grandkids visiting!!!

## 42:05 In the Weeds


42:24 @kattni and @jose david - overall CircuitPython library PR status discussion.
* https://github.com/jposada202020/PR_CP/blob/main/list.md


44:37 @Jose David: Could we create different tag for identifying PRs. I am thinking of two labels that could be helpful. One for when the PR could modify some learning guides, and the second when the PR will need a revision change.
Dylan mentioned to me that is good to have in the PR when the changes will break the API, but in the PR process I completely forgot this. https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_BME280/pull/52
So I think this could help, or if you have any other ideas?
## 47:08 Wrap-Up
