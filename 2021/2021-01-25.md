Python snakes its way to the new Raspberry Pi Pico board and RP2040 chip
 Pico 

 RP2040 Chip 

On January 21st, the Raspberry Pi Foundation launched their first microcontroller-class product: the Raspberry Pi Pico. Priced at just $4, it is built on RP2040, a brand-new microcontroller chip developed by Raspberry Pi. That's not a typo. Unlike the Raspberry Pi boards to date, all have been single board computers (SBC) running Linux. The RP2040 and Pico board run code is developed by the user and run on the chip with no operating system.
Besides the Pico board (yes many other boards in the market are also named Pico...), several other manufacturers have announced boards based on the RP2040 chip, which will be on sale by itself in the second quarter of this year. Of course Adafruit has announced several new boards (see below).
The board launched with support for programming in C, MicroPython, and CircuitPython (see below). Arduino has stated they will support the RP2040 soon.
More Information on the Pico board and the RP2040 microcontroller:

5:51 CircuitPython 6.2.0 Beta 0 out with support for RP2040 boards
 CircuitPython 6.2.0 Beta 0 

CircuitPython 6.2.0 provides preliminary support for the Raspberry Pi RP2040 chip, including the Raspberry Pi Pico and Adafruit’s own RP2040 boards.
Board and post specific changes:
* ESP32-S2:
   * Add TCP Server support.
   * Improve wifi checking about whether already connected when trying to connect.
   * Do not go into safe mode on watchdog reset.
   * Initialize touch in proper order. Fixes TouchIn and TouchAlarm.
   * Revert FeatherS2 status DotStar due to LDO2 issues.
* STM32 BlackPill: Add additional board build that supports an external SPI chip.
* ItsyBitsy M4: Fix erroneous comment in mpconfigboard.h.
* RP2040:
   * Initial port of CircuitPython to the RP2040.
   * Enable longints.

67:00 V-R3x: CubeSat mission just launched to space with CircuitPython!
 CubeSats 

 Transporter-1 

The V-R3x mission uses a swarm of three small satellites to demonstrate new technologies and techniques for radio networking and navigation. By developing and demonstrating these technologies on a small scale, they can be implemented for future multi-spacecraft missions. Using three satellites known as CubeSats, each about the size of a coffee mug, the mission will conduct a series of such demonstrations. They launched this past Sunday aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket as a part of the Transporter-1 mission which launched 140 additional satellites, the most satelllites launched aboard one spacecraft. The V-R3x CubeSats contain PyCubed boards programmed in CircuitPython.

Overall: We completed a sweep of CI updates across all the libraries, so now they’re all running the latest Black and using the new license formatting. Thanks to @dherrada and @foamyguy for all their hard work on that. The number of open PRs is creeping up, which is both excellent and worth paying attention to. It’s excellent because it indicates an increase in library contributions. It’s worth paying attention to because we don’t want PRs to languish without review or comment. If you’re interested in joining the review team, consider starting by taking a look at open library PRs and adding a review comment. The more reviewers we have, the more authors we can support.

@charlesburnaford (lurking)


44:15 @danh
* Released 6.2.0-beta.0 with initial RP2040 support.
* Debugging slow CIRCUITPY writes.
* Cleaned up enabling/disabling of json, re, and similar modules still in MicroPython style internally. Cleaned up documentation for those modules.
* To do:
   * Continue on slow CIRCUITPY writes. I have a quick solution but it prevents time.sleep() from lowering power draw.
   * Start work on secondary USB CDC (serial) channel.
   * Quick 6.2.0-beta.x releases to keep up with RP2040 and other fixes.


@davep (lurking)


46:42 @David.Glaude (lurking)
* Watching the RP2040 release unroll, reading as much as possible and trying to make sense of PIO
* Upgrade all my board to 6.1.0 while the first beta of 6.2.0 was out
* Trying to use my “Gameduino 3X Dazzler” on “Metro M4 AirLift Lite” => made my first PR to the core (and used the artefact): #4054

* Last week
   * Enhancement PR for Display_Button to allow user code to change the color more easily after initialization. Worked on this during Saturday morning stream.
   * Tinkering with a GridLayout that Kmatch and I collaborated on a few months back. Tweaking a few things and preparing it for publishing.
   * Working on enhancements for display_text and display_button to allow them to be resized after initialization, which will allow them to play nicely with the GridLayout mentioned above.
* This week
   * Experiment with neopixel strip, and RGBMatrix to determine the feasibility of using one or the other for a “Natural Sunlight” wakeup alarm.
   * Get my resizing changes to display_button and display_text cleaned up and ready to submit a PR for them.
   * Work on wording updates for a few guides: PID.codes reference, and pre-commit


49:53 @hierophect
* Last week:
   * Thought that SSL socket would be short and it wasn’t
   * Ran into issues implementing the LWIP version of connect, and getting the TLS implementations to play nice
   * Implemented some simple new functions like setBlocking and bind/listen/accept for TLS
   * Fixed a number of style issues including error messages
* This week
   * Review any remaining Socket issues to hotfix
   * While my power monitor is shipping, switch back to STM32 and bugfix
   * Start on control tests for low power

52:17 @jepler
* Last week:
   * AudioOut on esp32s2
      * Setting it aside until we can get an answer about noise/artifacts we are seeing on the output
      * 8bit, stereo samples “work” but are unlistenable due to the above bug
      * It’s in a branch of jepler/circuitpython if you want to look
   * In my own time, I wrote up a quick “wrap labels according to pixel width”, which @foamyguy is picking up to put into the label library https://emergent.unpythonic.net/01611420170
* This week:
   * Taking updates from Protomatter, which should enable “tiled displays”
   * Monthly guide feedback check
* Week after:
   * Staycation -- low Discord presence


54:17 @jerryn
* Ran into possible issue with time.sleep() and Requests on esp32s2
   * https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/4061
   * Works fine with deep sleep
* Anxiously awaiting RPi Pico bards arrival
* Want to investigate possible issue with RFM9x packet reception
   * Not sure if it is a real issue or due to setup - no issue open ...yet.
* Hope to return to working on Blinka for ESP32 with Micropython  - not high priority so no promises.
   * not much luck with esp8266 - may be due to memory limitations
* DIstracted  by recent arrival of OAK-D Vision AI module
   * So much to learn a about the AI Vision models
   * But it’s a really fun product.


@jfurcean (lurking)


31:26 @kattni
* Last two weeks:
   * Pico, Pico, Pico!
   * Wrote the Getting Started with Raspberry Pi Pico and CircuitPython guide
   * Finally tested the code, found an issue, fixed the issue in the code, wiring diagrams and guide, turns out it may not be an issue anymore anyway. Circle of technology.
* This week:
   * Update Getting Started with Pico guide
   * Test Circuit Playground PR
   * Clean up Circuit Playground library to remove unnecessary backwards compatibility
   * Create Adafruit_CircuitPython_DisplayIO_GUI - @foamyguy and @kmatch98, you’re up!
   * Stay on top of RP2040/Pico questions and support issues on Discord
* Over the weekend:
   * Ported my table top light box photo studio code to CircuitPython running on a Feather nRF52840, with a NeoPXL8 FeatherWing as a level shifter, and the Mini Color TFT FeatherWing with Joystick to display a control GUI.
   * Thanks again to @foamyguy and @kmatch98 for the GridLayout module, it made creating the GUI a lot simpler. And now that I’ve messed with it a bit, I have feature requests! 
   * Ran into a really weird issue where the setup worked in some configurations and not others. It screamed ground issue, but the initial continuity tests all indicated everything was fine, so there were several hours of banging my head against this, checking schematics, wiring, continuity, etc etc etc. In the end, the initial instinct was correct. It turns out a ground wire in one spot in the series had come off, so if things were plugged in and powered in a way that avoided that, it worked, if not, it failed. Of course it had to be on the super high density LED strip. Performed surgery and successfully restored the ground connection, and everything works as expected in the desired configuration.


@KevinThomas (lurking, text only)


36:55 kmatch98
* Last week: Demo’d ParallelBus working on ESP32-S2; submitted draft PR, would like some feedback on pin options

* accomplished:
   * TG-Gui and the CP TG-Gui standard library now on GitHub 
   * prototypes image widgets / started on an app launcher for watch
   * python module for importing modules and free-ing them later https://github.com/TG-Techie/tg_circuitpython_runtime_importer 
   * found a small error in adafruit_register
   * started to work on TG-Gui docs and realized I have no idea what I’m doing when it comes to documentation 
* todo:
   * As per bryan’s advice any documentation is better than no documation
   * by next meeting write a “quick and dirty guide to TG-Gui“ to walks through getting a small project up and running (hex color mixer)
   * possible live stream that guide as a follow along with the pyportal if there is interest
