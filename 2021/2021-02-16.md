3:38 Visual Studio Code comes to Raspberry Pi
 Visual Studio Code comes to Raspberry Pi 

Visual Studio Code officially comes to Raspberry Pi. As well as supporting Debian Linux on x64, there are now builds for ARM and ARM64 – both of which can run on Raspberry Pi OS (the ARM build on Raspberry Pi OS, the ARM64 on the beta of the 64-bit Raspberry Pi OS) - Raspberry Pi Blog
4:09 Focus: MIDI - Digital Music
With MIDI baked into CircuitPython, getting new boards like the Raspberry Pi Pico using this music standard is straightforward. Below are some projects using MIDI posted on the internet this week.
A Drum Machine with a Raspberry Pi Pico
 Drum machine 

A USB Midi 16 channel step sequencer for Raspberry Pi Pico, written in CircuitPython v6.2.0 - Twitter and code on GitHub.

Thanks to new core reviewer Anecdata.
Overall, we’ve been keeping an almost 1-beta-a-week-pace thanks to Dan.  Lots of new stuff, particularly for Raspberry Pi Pico.  The plan is to stay in the beta phase for a bit while we stabilize and add stuff for pico.  Sometime soon we’ll have other RP2040 boards too.

@charlesburnaford (lurking)


34:01 @danh
* Released CircuitPython 6.2.0-beta.2.
* Fixed `adafruit_sdcard` library to not need `.spi` property, and did other minor cleanup.
* Released LYWSD03MMC library.
* Working on secondary USB serial channel (CDC). Receives, but not seeing writes.


36:31 @David.Glaude (lurking)
* Testing various firmware on LYWSD03MMC Thermometer (I have 8 of 
them, 5 stock, 2 “atc1441” and 1 “pvvx”)
* Connected a Pico to a Mini PiTFT 240x240 using @Pimoroni Pico Explorer pinout so that I can try CP code by @wildestpixel https://gist.github.com/dglaude/a891cbf1266381a32471e7c78fb018e9
* Tested CP developpement with limited internet connectivity => size of UF2 file, do we have documentation you can download once and read offline, how do you program without doing github or google search???
* Non CP: Lost internet connectivity from Sunday morning until 3 hours ago (including 2 days of teleworking with a phone doing 4G/LTE tethering) => no Netflix, no YouTube, no IoT device, no online gaming, ...


37:37 @deshipu
* Finished Tetris https://github.com/deshipu/circuitpython-tetris-displayio
* Working on a isometric view for games
* Some prototyping for the universal game controls


39:05 @foamyguy
* Last Week
   * Review the community bundle enabled cookie-cutter PR and updated the learn guide to go along with the new version
   * Fixed a few issues that were found in the wrapping by pixels function
   * Tested and reviewed PR for scale fix inside of display_text 
* This Week
   * Final look over the base_alignment PR and merge if no objections
   * Continue working on refactor in my JSON GUI Inflater library to narrow it’s focus on inflating only, moving Layouts into the new DisplayIO_Layout library where appropriate
   * Test out the Vertical Progress bar and new Matrix Portal progress bar example


41:01 @hierophect
* Last week:
   * Finished fixing the I2C repeated start bug
   * Hacked at the ESP32S2 I2C/Wifi bugs, as well as the IDF update
   * Fixed some other minor stuff
   * Read through existing low-power code
* This week:
   * Putting down the I2C stuff until more progress goes through on the IDF update, there’s a number of people working on it and it seems like we just need to coordinate getting that work up and merged/tested.
   * Getting started wholesale on STM32 deep sleep


43:14 @Hugo
* Last week
   * Finished progressbar refactor, with some visual quirks to debug
   * Dug into including pylint execution as part of pre-commit (see “In the weeds”)
* This week
   * Wrap up progress bar basics, and move onto the next issues/features for progress bars


@jasonp (lurking)


44:57 @jepler (may miss meeting)
* Other stuff:
   * My state is affected by rolling black-outs “controlled outage areas” due to a severe winter storm putting reducing electrical supply and increasing demand.  If I’m not in the meeting today, that’s why.  We’re fine and safe.
* Last week:
   * Protomatter for RP2040 in progress (worked for me, Limor reported problems, will probably have investigated further by meeting time)
   * PIO: implemented reading from a PIO program (but so did Scott, we’ll take his version instead), finally started to understand how it works, found one core bug that affected PIO inputs
   * Work on a long-negelected WWVB (north american radio time code) receiver project in CircuitPython.  It can receive & decode the signal, showing the local time.
   * Figured out how to read RP2040’s BOOTSEL from C code (requires core modification to read from CircuitPython, hack hack: https://gist.github.com/jepler/c7676f0c5fe4eab9c584424d997a7991) -- do we want to polish this and add it to CP?
   * Worked on a document on how to participate in the CircuitPython meeting
   * Added the “requirements.txt” files to the Adafruit and Community Bundles.  In the future this will be used by circup to install the dependencies of each library.  (circup understands dependencies now, but has to request the info from github which is subject to API rate limits)
* This week: At least some of ...
   * Circuit(Python) Sculpture #2 -- it’s physically complete, I’m making a short video about it
   * Protomatter for RP2040 -- crashes when USB storage is accessed at same time. Maybe entering REPL also crashes? Can corrupt CIRCUITPY. Need to investigate, will look at the failure of `storage.erase_filesystem()` at the same time.
   * PIO - can drive 8 neopixel strips with 3 digital I/Os & an external shift register. One advantage of “parallel strips” is potential faster refresh, but it also takes time to re-format the data as required.  Will probably need a core extension to re-format the data.




51:06 @jerryn
* Last week
   * Worked with a Forum user to get an RFM9x project working
   * Explored an issue raised regarding use of GPS with RFM9x
      * Does not appear to be a real issue, but shows that freezing the rfm9x library into the build makes the feather_m0_rfm9x much more useable
      * Still exploring some problems the same user is having with using RFM9x on a feather_m0_bluefruit. Memory is tight but may be useable.
* Next week
   * Keep poking at rfm9x/bluefruit example.
* Fun - set up an RPi 4 as a HomeAssistant - nice Guide!
   * Found a nice feature to write NFC tags then use them to trigger events - very nice!

   * Continued working on ESPHome for a couple more days, but got stuck on an issue with WiFi and I2C not working at the same time.
   * Worked on some GitHub issues and PRs
   * Added some Bug Fixes to some of the Raspberry Pi Scripts
   * Attempted to get an alternative ST7789 driver working, but ran into the same issue.
   * Started working on first eInk guide in a series of eInk guides
* This Week:
   * Finish working on the first eInk guide
   * Start on the next
   * Repeat


1:01:30 @microDev [text only]
* Update ESP-IDF to V4.3
* Add NVM support for RP2040. UART in progress.

28:34 @tannewt
* Short week. Monday holiday and skiing Friday morning.
* Stream will be on Thursday.
* Catching up with email and such.
* Then, trying my darndest to wrap with the I2S and PIO PR.


29:51 @TG-Techie
  Last week:
* Found and patched brownout issue with watch (pull reset low with uv det ic for regulator)
* Fixed brightness issue. lower battery voltages decreased the backlight min and max
* Leaves one remaining known issue… bluetooth,  know to be hw specific not firmware
* Non-python: making a c code formatter for college’s maker space. Like “black” but for c
  Next week:
* Swap watch module with feather module to see if it a watch board is the issue
* Pull fixes /  changes from some upstream libs into CP frozen lib
* Play with changing the SimpleRect PR to see if it is plausible to make RoundRect more efficient

1:02:17 @Hugo:
* Add the pylint process to be run as part of pre-commit rather than within the GH workflow. 

Backstory and reasoning: During FoamyGuy’s stream on the 13th, we had a discussion with some other folks about Cookiecutter, pre-commit, and going about the setup of a new library repository. One thing that I’ve done locally, which I’ve found adds value, is to run the pylint scripts from the pre-commit hook. It helps avoid running a GitHub build which identifies the issue(s), making the changes necessary, pushing to the PR, and circle back again. Example pre-commit configuration here: https://gist.github.com/hugodahl/82c8ef5a8ef3b68229b0043c150cc7f5

This change would make it so that the GH build workflow is updated to remove the pylint call. Fortunately, since both changes would happen within the library repository, it should be trivial. Unfortunately, this would require yet another pass through all the libraries, or those we want updated, to make this change. This would also require a change to the “cookiecutter-adafruit-circuitpython” repository.

   * Just wondering if there is any plan long term speaking to implement I2CPeripheral for the PICO, or even if this would be possible


1:09:54 @jerryn - future of bluefruitspi library
   * It works and it is the only way to use CP with the feather_m0_bluefruit or SPI Bluefruit Friend. There are a few old issues that I thought I’d try to clean up unless someone else is interested in them.
   * Awhile ago, we briefly discussed adding support for the UART Bluefruit Friend. At that time, If I recall correctly, it was not done because bleio is so much better and the Bluefruit was not worth spending time on. I wonder if we should reconsider since the Bluefruit devices do exist and are still available.
   * Would adding support for the UART be OK. Any reason not to? I’ll be happy to add it to my “todo” list.
   * Or do you want to stop supporting this library.  


1:13:58 @deshipu Sorting displayio.Group https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/4201


I'm working on a game that uses an isometric view, and one thing I need for this is to sort the sprites representing mobs according to their depth on the screen. In displayio the drawing order is determined by the order of elements in the displayio.Group, and I'm wondering what would be the best way of keeping it sorted.

1:21:41 @David.Glaude (text only => quick question)


Is https://github.com/ghidraninja/piodisasm a Pio Disassembler anyway useful for the pio assembler library https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_PiOASM to try to make sure it is complete and give the right result?
How many Pio assembler syntax exist and what is the “canonical” syntax?
What feature are missing in current pio assembler library?
