### 3:09 Piper Make Brings Block Programming to CircuitPython
 Piper Make 

Piper Learning is releasing a new product, Piper Make, which is a browser-based coding platform for the Raspberry Pi Pico. It has a block-programming interface based on Google Blockly. The underlying code is CircuitPython!
You can access the interface, which is similar to MakeCode, at https://make.playpiper.com/.
Under the hood, there is a CircuitPython helper library Piper has created.

27:07 @v923z
* Added functions to ulab to interface with peripheral devices producing 32-bit integers

@anecdata (lurking)


27:24 @brentru (text only)
* Got to work with the pico a bit, and the pico feather
* Wrote a “quickstart” guide for adding WiFi to circuitpython RP2040 projects
* Briefly gets you started with sending rp2040 data w/ HTTP and MQTT
   * https://learn.adafruit.com/quickstart-rp2040-pico-with-wifi-and-circuitpython
* Working mostly on non-cp projects with some circuitpython sprinkled here and there.


27:48 @CGrover (text only)
* Last week: Submitted PR to include a settable brushed DC motor recirculation current mode parameter for the Adafruit_CircuitPython_Motor.motor library. Learned a bit more about PyLint in the process. Starting work on the learning guide rewrite in anticipation of the PR merge.
* This week: Will address converting raw measurements to Lux and UVI for the LTR390 true UV sensor. Plans are to update the supporting library.
* Spotted a Stemma DRV8830 voltage-regulated motor controller in the wild (on Ladyada’s desk). Excited to get my hands on one for testing.
* Unrelated: After months of downsizing, the commercial side of the recording studio is now officially closed. Not sure how the space will be reconfigured just yet, but it will certainly involve multiple strings of NeoPixels and the underutilized Ekornes recliner.


@charles Burnaford (Lurking)


28:53 @danh
* Disabled secondary USB CDC serial channel by default, because it is confusing existing workflows. You can still make a custom build.
* Made a simple library to identify the REPL and secondary (“data”) channels on host computers. Will submit a PR to Mu to use this to identify boards and the REPL channel. 
* Fixed ESP32-S2 I2C problem with a small change in the I2C driver in esp-idf. It’s not obvious why the fix works0. I narrowed the problem down to something in the closed-source ESP wifi stack. (:


31:30 @david.glaude (lurking)
* Text scrolling demo for Michael Horne on his 11x7 matrix breakout + fix the y-axis mirror after he tested my code on the hardware
* Driver and simpletest for 5x5 RGBmatrix (untested because I don’t have the hardware): https://twitter.com/DavidGlaude/status/1369614613306818561?s=20
* MagTag + SCD30 to display C02 (did not find a way to “power off” the sensor during sleep) https://twitter.com/DavidGlaude/status/1369814192501428225?s=20
* pHAT on Pico (with a Zero form factor):
   * Googly Eyes on Scroll pHAT HD https://twitter.com/DavidGlaude/status/1369422737102540801

* Last week:
   * Display_text guide published
   * Began work on a Touch Deck project in collaboration with JP
   * Display_text refactor merged, and reviews on many PRs that were waiting on it.
* This week
   * Convert the current Touch Deck code to work with Feather RP2040 and 3.5” Featherwing, and wrap up any other loose ends. Also make a layer configuration for PyCharm with helpful Git commands and other shortcuts. 3D Print the enclosure stand for it.
   * Finish up reviews on the last few remaining display_text and displayio_layout PRs.
   * Begin work on an easter themed game that involves a bunny finding colorful eggs and eating carrots for energy.
   * Add a 3.5” Featherwing helper to the Featherwing library




34:40 @hierophect
* Last week:
   * I’ve had a rough couple of weeks and I’m sort of outstaying my welcome on the STM32 power stuff. It’s mostly done but I’m stuck on deep sleep interrupt behavior. I’m going to keep cracking at it today with a logic analyzer but I’m also trying to make myself available for more urgent material
   * Fixed some minor bugs, like a deinit problem with UART
   * Caught the STM32F4 Discovery board to do everything the Feather can, since they have the same silicon.
   * Did a little research about overclocking and the options for changing the clock settings of Circuitpython over resets
* This week:
   * Test audiopwmio
   * Going to try and nail this deep sleep stuff and get some final notes on low power consumption for the docs
   * Going to try and bundle at least RTC in with that since it’s basically done already.
   * In general, available for other assignments, could fix some recent socket requests, etc.


36:55 @Hugo
* Last week:
   * Get ProgressBar code refactored to appease Pylint’s “duplicate-code” rule
   * Start looking into the Magtag bitmap crash issue
* This week:
   * Finish refactor
   * More work on the Magtag bitmap crash issue
   * Learn about computers to PTT on Discord


37:32 @jepler
* Last week:
   * Wrote a new guide on circuit sculpture
   * Enabled MP3 playback on RP2040, but only extremely low bitrate files work
   * Fixed an RTC bug on RP2040
   * Reverted a space-saving commit, but may need to reevaluate it in light of the discoveries about flash speed on RP2040
   * Ran the meeting
   * The PCF metrics bugfix was merged
   * Update the rgbmatrix guide with a page for rp2040
* This week:
   * See if audiomixer can be enabled on rp2040
   * Enable choosing the pin for pio’s conditional JMP PIN” instruction
   * Test i2sout for pico/rp2040
   * May be starting on some imx stuff 
* Fun stuff:
   * Will move my WWVB Clock from Matrixportal to Feather RP204, a more accurate local clock will improve its ability to stay synchronized
   * Got to fix a daylight saving time bug in the code, have to wait for next year to test it


40:59 @jerryn
* Had fun playing with my toys
   * Did find that I was able to install the PiTFT kernel update for my Braincraft Hat with the latest RPi 4 kernel.  Seems to be OK now. Also works with AMG8833 Thermal Camera
* Will do it again next week
   * Hope to add battery monitor to LYWSD03MCC - maybe…
   * Some catchup on the Fingerprint Library and issue with differences between various sensors.




42:39 @Jose David Montoya (Lurking, Text Only)
Last week:
* PR adding a solution from @k3wals for the I2CPeripheral samd51 corrections in the CTRLC bit
* Draft PR for the Feather RP2040 I2Cpheripheral
* Corrections for the PRs for display text
* PR for directional label
* Exploring how to port encoding polylines to CP
* PR for label Styles
* Some PR for Core documentation
This Week
* Work on the comments from scott in the I2Cpheripheral
* Review and corrections of Core documentation (Readthedocs) (related to Issue #321)
* Corrections on feedback for directional label
* If decided path to take, work in style library


43:30 @kattni
* Last week:
   * Hugo updated cookiecutter to include a new pre-commit hook to run pylint on tests directories similarly to examples minus one pylint: disable
   * Updated Fritzing to the latest version, so far haven’t run into any issues
   * Added a “reverse lookup” pinouts list to the Feather RP2040, so the pins are now listed both by pin name = functionality, and pin function = pin names.
   * Updated AMG8833 guide for STEMMA QT rev
   * Worked with Anne further on interim taking over the newsletter
   * Wrote the first template in the Learn system with the new templating feature
      * First template is “Blink” using the D13 LED.
   * Found a ton of bug with the new templating feature in Learn
   * Other miscellaneous that I’m certain I’m forgetting
* This week:
   * Chat with Brent about getting datetime passing pylint (done)
   * Continue on the template creation mission
      * The eventual plan is to “recreate” the CircuitPython Essentials guide with templates, so each guide will have its own tailored pages so we’re not dealing with “but my board looks different” or “there is no LED” or whatever other feedback is constantly coming up because the guide was written to be generally applicable, not necessarily specifically applicable.
   * Update the CLUE guide to have info on the debug pins
   * New products process for Cyberdeck
   * MIDI FeatherWing guide


48:10 @kmatch98
Last week:
* bitmaptools: Added fill_region and draw_line functions

   * Wrote the 2.13” EPD Guide
   * Created a PR for the RPLIDAR to add additional functionality, but need to update it some more
   * Looked into an issue where a user was having trouble updating the WiFi coprocessor firmware
   * Fixed an issue with the 2.7” EPD in arduino where the RED and black were swapped
* This Week:
   * Working on misc github issues
   * Possibly starting a guide on the 2.9” E-Inks which will mostly be gathering pages from existing guides and making them look more uniform.
   * Probably work on the RPLIDAR library a bit more


50:30 @microDev (text-only)
* Did some esp32s2 i2c and idf update work.
* Added code formatting and translation checks to pre-commit.

## 51:49 In The Weeds
52:17 @Jose David @foamyguy
        There is PR#139 for display_text label to introduce styling. Do we want to create a helper library that will be available for other widgets to use? Or keep the styling for individual libraries?


Proposed new “ColorHelper” library would contain things like:
* Helper functions for converting between numeric Hex color code, tuple RGB, and string hex color code.
* Possibly helper functions for manipulating colors (i.e. lighten or darken by X amount)
* Hold color theme definitions that could be imported by other libraries and user  code and easily applied to displayio objects.

Interfacing circuitpython objects with ulab. E.g. enable displayio’s bitmap to accept buffers, and return buffers, so that data could directly be piped into numerical arrays.


Context:


Thermal camera without ulab:
https://github.com/dglaude/circuitpython_phat_on_pico/blob/main/mlx90640_240x240.py
With some ulab optimisation to find min, max and map to 64 colour:
https://github.com/dglaude/circuitpython_phat_on_pico/blob/main/mlx90640_ulab.py




Slow part:
* mlx90640 library (math computation, copy of buffer and allocation)
https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_MLX90640/blob/fb603e4ac3ad15b2cf2bcd0f677de771dc369fb1/adafruit_mlx90640.py


* copying from ulab array to displayio.Bitmap:


image_bitmap = displayio.Bitmap(24, 32, number_of_colors)
inta=ulab.array((npframe-min_t)*factor,dtype=ulab.int8)
index = 0
for h in range(24):
    for w in range(32):
        image_bitmap[h, w] = inta[index] 
        index+=1


David will create an issue summarizing the Discord discussion, then others can add tips to that issue and hopefully someone will pick it up.  Please ping @v923z on the issue!


1:08:38 @v923z
The circuitpython repository is not searchable. Can anything be done about that?
