## 5:11 Community News
5:12 CircuitPython 6.1.0-rc.0 is now out
Fixes and enhancements
* Fix initialization of onboard NeoPixels. #3934. Thanks @DavePutz.
* Update ulab to 1.6.0. #3929. Thanks @jepler.

5:50 CircuitPython Blinka for Single Board Computers Explained
The CircuitPython.Org website has been updated to include an explanation of what the Blinka layer for SBCs is:
Blinka brings CircuitPython APIs and, therefore, CircuitPython libraries to single board computers (SBCs). It is a pip installable Python library that runs in normal "desktop" Python. The CircuitPython runtime isn't used. CircuitPython libraries can also be installed via pip.
See the guide for further details.

   * atmel-samd DAC channel selection
   * BLE timeout value logic and rounding of timeout and other time-based values
   * len(alarm.sleep_memory)
* Re-tested MagTag power consumption using different alarm types.


38:39 @DavidGlaude (lurking)
* Tested UV index sensor VEML6075 with nail lamp: https://twitter.com/DavidGlaude/status/1346194486028808196?s=20
* PoC of Tetris on Quico (Matrix Portal 32x64 controlled by WiiMote): https://twitter.com/DavidGlaude/status/1346978235658231810?s=20
* Made a stepper counter PoC with a Clue: https://twitter.com/DavidGlaude/status/1348272838755680258?s=20

   * 8 Xiaomi BLE thermometer (4$) LYWSD03MMC: Plan to monitor every room and alarm if temperature is too high at the wrong time.


40:03 @foamyguy
* Last week
   * Update my display frame library to allow the user to configure where the label should get aligned. Previously it was always centered at the top, now it can be top/bottom and left, right, or center.
   * Testing PyPortal and PortalBase refactoring PRs
   * Wrap up work on PR for ascender / descender use in display_text label.
   * Testing msgpack PR and disabling it in a few smaller builds to get it passing CI
   * Working on display layouts library to allow nesting with the fancier layout types. I.e. to put one LinearLayout inside of another for building up more complex UIs but without the need to specify x/y, coordinates for everything.
* This week
   * Try to finish up the work with LinearLayout and then use the module to make a Trivial Pursuit inspired UI for the the IOT trivia app
   * Looking into dirty rectangle tracking in Blinka_Displayio to see about improved performance
   * Update bitmap_label for ascender and descender.


42:14 @hierophect
* Last 6 weeks:
   * Stuck on the socket API
* This week
   * Continue to be stuck on the socket API.
* All foreseeable future weeks, forever
   * Continue to be stuck on the socket API
* But actually
   * Finished guide
   * Talked about the analog limits on the ESP32S2
   * Working on the non-blocking elements of Socket
   * Trying to pin down error behavior for Socket based on Cpython


@jasonp (lurking)


44:40 @jepler
* Last week:
   * Worked more on font converter than expected
   * Finally made progress again on esp32-s2 i2sout
   * Wrote my #CircuitPython2021 document
* This week:
   * Scoping out the difficulty of bringing our current mp3 decoder lib to esp32-s2 (it has assembly optimizations for ARM CPUs but not xtensa)
      * Update: It works, but is poorly optimized.  A 32kbit/s mp3 does play, but not a 128kbit/s mp3.  We may not add it at this time due to these limitations
   * Looking at some problems on Raspberry Pi with the BrainCraft hat, my Linux expertise may come in handy :)
   * Taking a look at issues in Adafruit_CircuitPython_SD to see what I can fix
   * If anyone has a cool ulab demo that uses DisplayIO but not audio, send me a note in the text chat


@jfurcean (lurking)


48:13 @jerryn
*  Last week
   * Mostly a loss due to “doomscrolling after Wednesday  :-(
   * Submitted a PR to implement using the DotStar on the UMFEATHERS2 for status. In review.
      * Very helpful when testing deep sleep
   * Experimented with deep sleep TimeAlarm - working well sending data to AIO
   * Basic testing of Pin Alarm - WIP
   * Tried to get “blinka” working on ESP8266 with Micropython        
      * Got as far as being able to import board… but lots of problems
      * May be better trying to add esp32 support
* Next week
   * Continue Pin Alarm testing
      * Goal to have Pin Alarm wake up and send data via RFM9x
   * Continue “blinka” on Micropython exploration
   * Heads up - latest RPi Kernel update not playing nicely with pitft kernel module


@jfurcean (lurking)


52:13 @kattni
* Last week:
   * Library PR/Issue sweep started
   * Reorganised the assets in the newsletter repo for 2020
   * Fixed up a couple of things in a guide based on feedback
   * Started a new project
* This week:
   * Finish up two recently published guides - two small fixes needed.
   * Continue project.


@KevinThomas (text only, lurking)


55:44 @MakerMelissa
* Last Week:
   * Catching up on issues and PRs from being gone and other tech debt
   * Picked up and completed a circuitpython.org PR that @tannewt had started
   * Did some major refactoring of the PyPortal library to use PortalBase
* This Week:
   * Test out the PyPortal refactor on a few more PyPortal projects to ensure high compatibility
   * Move some of the Web-based projects from glitch to github
   * Look into some of the issues with the Raspberry Pi and the display problems that arose from the kernel update
   * Write up my #circuitpython2021 post
   * Work on Blinka PyPortal refactor which should be much easier
   * Look at group scaling issue in Blinka displayio if time


57:19 @Mark(gamblor) (lurking, may be text-only)
* Last week submitted draft PR of fixed busdevice in core
* This week will submit commit to re-enable it into the PR and ask for further review


57:43 @microDev (text-only)
* Last week :-
   * Took a break from working on software and designed a new CircuitPython compatible dev-board based on the esp32-s2 and with usb power delivery.
https://twitter.com/microDevIN/status/1346524366423486464
* This week :
   * Back to working on software… 
   * Fixed a couple of TouchAlarm bugs.
   * Will be sending the dev-board for fabrication. 


@Mr. Certainly [lurking]


28:01 @tannewt
* More #circuitpython2021
* Stream Friday
* Odds and ends in between
* Weird idea this weekend of Basic Python. Thinking about what CircuitPython would be on the Raspberry Pi 400


30:22 @TG-Techie
        Completed:
* TG-Gui version 0.6.0. The core and standard library are now separate making cross platforms implementations far easier (the first one being circuitpython/displayio)
* made an on-device hex mixer for the pyporta to test the new framework l (example on twitter)
* Drafted a revised version of the TG-Watch board (https://github.com/TG-Techie/TG-Watch02-PCB) definition which fixes a few errors/updates
        Todo:
* Put the core, CP. std library, and the hex mixer up on github for free/open use
* Pull in the final version of the TG-Watch board definition and update the circuitpython website to match


32:29 @v923z
* Last X weeks:
   * Added frombuffer function to ulab; might be useful for piping data to arrays directly from ADC, other peripheral devices
   * Re-organised ulab code, it has a truly numpy-compatible interface now
* This week:
   * Will try to recover the circuitpython version (sub-modules), update docs
## 58:28 In The Weeds
59:00 @ TG-Techie
* Is there a maximum py-stack size in circuitpython? From testing call depth did not increase past 110 calls even with huge py-stack
* Is there a format for CP libraries that depend on non-cp specific python repos? (Does this belong in the weeds?)
* Answered: Is the max recursion depth separate from the max function calling depth in circuitpython? 
   * “Recursion” is used sloppily to refer to call depth, even though it’s not a recursive call. I would like to change this message, and started to do that. But it actually originates from CPython, so I thought changing it might bring on more confusion. --danh


1:02:26 @jerryn
* Question about PinAlarm 
   * After setting up with:
      * pin_alarm = alarm.pin.PinAlarm(pin=board.IO7, value=False, pull=True)
   * If IO7 is grounded, then 
      * alarm.exit_and_deep_sleep_until_alarms(pin_alarm)
   * “Pauses” until IO7 is no longer low -- is that the expected behavior?
   * It’s not clear in the code where this happens.


1:06:14 @v923z
* Very short question for Scott: do you still favour sub-modules over numpy-scipy compatibility?


1:17:12 @jepler
* Why not have a `voltage` property on AnalogIn objects, which is pre-scaled according to the reference_voltage property?


1:21:24 @charlesburnaford
* is there a library for the TCA9548A I2C Multiplexer (alternate library)
Maybe have a version of BUSIO I2C module with an extra parameter to indicate which bus the object is using on the multiplexer.
@jepler: Check out https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_TCA9548A
