## 17:43 Status Updates

18:15 @jepler
* Last week:
   * Substantially completed the OV2640 library 
   * Merged micropython 1.16 (PR is ready for review)
   * Implemented Dan’s (or maybe Scott’s) idea of reduced size of core property objects, but net savings was rather small, and it probably decreases performance, so we’ll probably leave it out for now.  (PR is on github)
   * Implemented Dan’s idea of “split up” type structures for core types.  Saves 1.5kB but requires more discussion (including with micropython and ulab) even if we decide we want to take it.  Need to benchmark whether it affects speed. (PR is on github) 
* This week:
   * Finishing up the OV2640 library & adding to bundle
   * Writing a guide covering the OV2640 and OV7670 cameras in CircuitPython
   * Start working on a project for an upcoming guide.  I’m excited to do a project guide again, it’s been awhile!

   * PyOhio accepted my talk proposal “The First Five Minutes”, which will be pre-recorded and the conference happens on 31 July
   * Received my second COVID vaccine last week after a bit of a debacle


23:15 @MakerMelissa
* Last Week:
   * Finished fixing remaining repos from move over to main
   * Figured out how to re-assign the Chip Enable pins on the Raspberry Pi boards to avoid deassert conflicts with Blinka
   * Wrote a script to assist and updated the main Raspberry Pi Blinka guide
   * Refactored WebSerial ESPTool to allow better reuse of the core programming
* This Week:

* Unrelated-ish: Preserved and reinstalled two interior doors in the 1940s section of the house. This was a week for legacy projects, indeed.


26:11 @danh
* Finished the `keypad` module, which supports push buttons and keys in multiple ways. Ladyada did functionality testing. The PR is now ready for review.
