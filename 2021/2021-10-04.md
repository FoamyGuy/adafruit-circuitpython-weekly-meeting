* @CptIglo for trying the Kitty Paw Keypad project and finding some significant issues, which led to a code rewrite and some displayio delays that need further investigation

@DaveP (lurking)


17:04 @foamyguy
* @deshipu for sharing a simplified wiring diagram for MAX7219 and an 8x8 LED Matrix. And everyone else who helped me through mapping the pins with a multimeter.

## 17:44 Status Updates




18:04 @jepler
* Last week:
   * BLE Thermal Printer Guide
   * Started on OV5640 camera module support
      * Testing module is https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JF7QVL4 and the easiest board to run it with is the Kaluga devkit, pick some up if you’re interested in helping me test the sensor once the driver is available
* This week:
   * Continuing on OV5640
   * May work on a text label printing program for the ble “cat” printer for myself, not on adafruit time


19:26 @kattni
* Last week:
   * Published the Proximity Trinkey guide
   * Finished the ANO Rotary Encoder guide, and it is now awaiting moderation
* This week:
   * LED glasses guide
   * AT Tiny breakout guide
   * Misc.


21:37 @MakerMelissa
* Last Week:
   * Finished Rotary Animated Gif Player Guide
   * Got back to JavaScript stuff and making good progress in updating the JavaScript BLE File Transfer library
* This Week:
   * Finish updating library
   * Implement some File related features into the CircuitPython Code Editor


22:15 @danh
* Wrote “Custom HID Devices in CircuitPython” guide, which includes a partial Microsoft Surface Dial emulator. The NKRO guide page @jepler wrote has been moved to this guide.
* Working on boot keyboard support. Will see how easy it is to do feature reports as well.
* Found a problem with displayio delaying USB messages, causing inadvertent key autorepeat. Will discuss this with @tannewt when he returns.
* Looking at bugs to fix for 7.x.x.


24:15 @foamyguy
* Last week
   * Learned how to map the pins of an 8x8 LED matrix and wired it up to test the PR that added typing information to MAX7219 driver
   * Begin trying to figure out a good way to split Blinka Displayio example scripts so the display setup is self contained and easy to swap out to different displays.
   * Published short video showing how to install CircuitPython stubs with PyCharm and some of the benefits from having it
* This week
   * Solder headers on pico and test the MAX7219 driver with it
   * Start making displayio based example scripts for various sensors
   * Record a high level Introduction to Displayio that will cover the basic building blocks and how they work together
## 26:25 In The Weeds
26:43 
@foamyguy, @anecdata - Where would be the most appropriate place to start collecting example code for circuitpython core modules that don’t have library repos with examples directories e.g. displayio, vectorio, wifi. Maybe an examples directory in the core repo? Or a new “CoreExamples” or similar repo?


31:41 
@jepler hacktoberfest - how to handle PRs so submitters get credit
Check out https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/resources/maintainers - this is based on my understanding of that document
* If you can promptly merge or give a PR an “accept” review, do that, it’s enough.
* If not, but it’s clearly a well-intentioned PR that may need some work, add the label hacktoberfest-accepted to the PR and let the author know what work is needed.
* If it’s clearly not well-intentioned work, tag as invalid or spam.
* Contact someone with extra github powers such as @jepler @kattni @danh @tannewt if the hacktoberfest-accepted or spam label is not available (@-mention on issue may be best?)
Note that this year for the first time it’s possible to get your hacktoberfest “points” by doing maintainer actions in addition to submitting good PRs!


Do we want to add the hacktoberfest topic to any/all CP repos? It does not seem to be required, but some people may search github for topics.
