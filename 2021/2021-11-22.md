### MicroPython adds official SAMD21 and SAMD51 MCU support
 MicroPython adds official SAMD21 and SAMD51 MCU support 

MicroPython has added mainline support for the Microchip SAMD21 and SAMD51 microcontrollers.
The REPL can be over USB VCP or USART using board specified USART pins (initialized on startup).
Flash usage is flexible. The internal Flash Block Device samd.Flash() is initialized with littlefs1 in frozen module _boot.py, 64k for the SAMD21, 128K for the SAMD51.
SPI bus usage is still a work in progress.
More information can be found on the MicroPython GitHub repo.
### 3:41 CircuitPython Online IDEs
 CircuitPython Online IDEs 

The idea is simple: have a web-based development environment for CircuitPython. This eliminates the need for installing software and provides a unified interface. It definitely is possible with newer web technologies built into modern builds of the Chrome web browser. GitHub user Mr-Coxall first started this trend two years ago. The idea was picked up by GitHub user sensebox 8 months ago.
Most recently, GitHub user urfdvw has made progress with a rather nice web based editor fittingly named "CircuitPython Online IDE". Available in English and Chinese, the project is well documented and has many features. There are serial console and plot output capabilities.
Learn more: YouTube, GitHub, and CircuitPython Online IDE.
### 4:32 ESP32-S3 mini modules make for an easy 'S3 Feather
 ESP32-S3 Feather 

Adafruit picked up some ESP32-S3 Mini modules from Digi-Key and surprise! They are pin compatible with the S2 Mini modules. That means they were able to upgrade their ESP32-S2 Feather to use the newest dual-core+BLE chipset. All the pins have been tested, NeoPixel works and so does I2C… they are fabricating some of these and will have some for the Adafruit shop as soon as Adafruit can get a reel from Espressif - Adafruit Blog and YouTube.
### 5:08 Wirelessly Code your Bluetooth Device with CircuitPython
 Wirelessly Code your Bluetooth Device with CircuitPython 

Did you know you can transfer files over BLE? This is the basis for being able to edit CircuitPython files directly on your device.
Adafruit has been working on a new web-based Code Editor for CircuitPython. This allows you to edit files directly on your Bluetooth devices using just the Chrome web browser without installing any additional software. The great thing about this code editor is it is written completely in JavaScript, so it only runs on your computer and none of your data is ever uploaded to a server - Adafruit Learning System and https://code.circuitpython.org/.
### 5:48 Meet the Maker: Anne Barela
 Meet the Maker 

Adafruit engineer Anne Barela was interviewed for the latest issue of HackSpace Magazine, Issue 49.
If you’ve ever programmed anything in CircuitPython and understood the instructions the first time, you probably have Anne Barela to thank. She’s a consulting engineer at Adafruit, where she puts her vast array of experience into helping people make cool stuff that ‘just works’. She’s had her work go into space on the Shuttle, she helped make sure the world’s computers didn’t melt when the clocks reset to zero in the year 2000, and she’s a big fan of open source. We got a bit flustered when we spoke to her to be honest – where do you start with a career that’s included Caltech, Hewlett-Packard, NASA, Boeing, and the US Diplomatic Service? So, we started with something we can all understand: CircuitPython.
You can read about Anne, her varied professions, her making trajectory and what she’s doing now in the latest HackSpace Magazine - Adafruit Blog.

**Updated Libraries**
Too many to list! Check https://adafruit-circuit-python.s3.amazonaws.com/adabot/bin/reports/circuitpython_library_report_20211122.txt for the full list.


Overall: We finished a library update sweep which is why there’s too many updated libraries to list in the notes document. We’re continuing to see excellent contributions and updates to the libraries - thank you to everyone who has been submitting updates over the last week and beyond. As well, thank you to the review team - you all make it possible for us to continue moving forward at such a pace, we could not do it without you. Most of the time, by the time I get to a PR in my email, it has already been reviewed. Greatly appreciated!

   * KB2040
   * Misc.


24:16 @MakerMelissa
* Last Week:
   * Finished up the CircuitPython Code Editor guide
   * Updated the Raspberry Pi Blinka guide with a Python Extended Bus library page
   * Updated the BrainCraft/Voice Bonnet Audio page with python usage information
   * Added a bunch of missing boards to the Circuipython.org website
* This Week:
   * Short week for me
   * Working on a new guide involving using CircuitPython to control a laser


25:02 @mark(gamblor) [lurking]
* Submitted IS31 PR and took it out of draft
* Looking at ways to incorporate the ring lights and a python helper library




25:20 @tannewt
* Short week this week due to Thanksgiving. Will be making an Apple Pie
* Last week got the broadcom builds going in the CI and optimized the submodule checkout along the way.
* There is an outstanding issue on the Raspberry Pi Zero 2W that I can’t track down.
* I’m still going to get a PR out this week for the code. More folks are trying it and it’s been baking long enough that it needs to get into main. We can work more on it there.
* Will start by doing a pass over the commits to ensure no debug prints are included in unrelated files.
* No deep dive this week.




26:45 @CGrover (text only)
* This week
   * Added new widgets to the scalable retro widgets project. Thoroughly enjoyed @foamyguy’s review during his stream – will have some improvements coming based upon his and @dexter_starboard’s suggestions. 
   * Submitted a PR for Display_Shapes.Line class to allow line color change post-instantiation, needed for the HP-35 display module widget.
  

* Next
   * Add three new widget prototypes to the library. Will continue to look for ways to improve the UI – and subsequently expand my Python skill set if I can successfully rearrange a few stubborn synapses.
   * Refocus on creating a Display_Shapes.Arc graphics primitive.
   * Review Display_Shapes.RoundRect outlining method to see why circles morph into squares when the stroke value increases.
   * Revise last year’s animated MatrixPortal Snowman decoration. Will either add a blizzard mode or something related to global warming.


27:49 @danh
* Working on asyncio Learn Guide. You can see the work in progress at https://learn.adafruit.com/cooperative-multitasking-in-circuitpython?view=all&preview_token=di81p2zLknUEEkeM-57bPw
* Investigating some problems with asyncio task cancellation and exception reporting.


29:20 @David.Glaude (lurking)
* Testing CP on PiZero 2W (and Pi3A) after each Deep Dive stream
* Turning a MCP2221 into a console cable for the Pi UART
* Testing and creating a “simpletest” for the NES mini controller with the WiiChuck library: https://github.com/jfurcean/CircuitPython_WiiChuck
* Trying to boot a PYBStick RP2040 into CP (failure but it work with Pico MP firmware): https://github.com/mchobby/pyboard-driver/tree/master/PYBStick-RP2040


29:53 @foamyguy
* This week
   * Make macropad configuration for scoring trivia game for Hackaday Remoticon
   * Try out some of @CGrover’s new displayio widgets. Tested a few of them and made a sound reactive bar graph with one of them that runs on a CLUE and uses the on-board microphone
   * Small fix to some missing newlines in cookie cutter
* Next week
   * Try out some different configurations for readthedocs to hopefully narrow down any possible differences between local builds, github actions builds, and builds inside of RTD.
   * Play with contents of newest adabox
   * Look into refactoring bitmap_font to use with context processors


32:01 @g3holliday (text only)
* Kinda trying to work on a CP scrolling text method for the Eyelight Glasses
* Debugging Thonny Python w/ ESP32-S2 and nRF52840 issues with not running code after changes are made


32:22 @jerryn
* Experimented with temperature response of the on board bme280 on the new feather S2 board. Ran test with an si7021 sensor in parallel.
   * Normal use -- temperature sensor reads high by ~ 15 degrees F
   * Deep sleep (5 minute cycle) - with battery power --  temps agree within 1 degree.
   * Deep sleep when battery charging (USB wall charger - no data)-- bme280 read high by 10-15 degrees F
      * Starts cooling as the battery reaches full charge and ramps down the charge rate. 
      * At full charge (charging LED off) it is back within 1 degree F.
   * Able to get good measurements with deep sleep and battery power.
* Opened a few issues on rfm69 repo in response to some forum questions.
   * Mostly documentation but may result in a few minor changes.
