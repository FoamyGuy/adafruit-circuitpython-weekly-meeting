## 18:22 Status Updates
19:05 @kattni
* Last week (short week):
   * Started MacroPad library
   * Published MacroPad guide
* This week:
   * MacroPad library
   * Add to MacroPad guide if needed
   * Think on possible MacroPad project
   * More template work.
   * Beginning to replace CP Essentials pages in older board guides with templates.


20:00 @kmatch (missing meeting)
* About a month ago some totally new (and paid) work has come across my desk that is taking me full time to come up to speed to learn and execute. If there’s anything CP-related you need my specific attention feel free to ping me on discord. 


20:22 @MakerMelissa
* Last Week:
   * Worked on stability improvements for the Web Serial ESPTool for the ESP32.
      * Unfortunately it refuses to cooperate despite matching the official ESPTool byte for byte in what it is sending.
      * Putting on hold for now
* This Week:
   * Working on a Microsoft Lobe Cat Detector Guide
   * Playing catch-up with some GitHub issues
   * Possibly resuming ESPTool if I think of something


21:08 @sommersoft (text only; if attending)
* Past Few Weeks:
   * Adabot:
      * Added some testing
      * Fixed an oversight from adding tests that broke stuff
      * Did some dependency cleanup/updates.
      * Started pylint’ing. Includes applying black formatting, and adding pre-commit for black/pylint runs on pushes/PRs.
* This Week:
   * Continue work on Adabot pylint.


@anecdata (lurking)


21:39 @CGrover (text only):
* Between some carpentry projects, I’m still plugging away at converting old in-place Arduino projects to CircuitPython. Phil Burgess’ Fake TV project is a favorite and now works on the MetroM4 + NeoPixel shield as well as a portable NeoTrinkey version.
* Wrapping up a PyPortal touch screen version of the Thermal Camera this week.
* Non-CircuitPython:
   * The interfering carpentry projects are the last few punch list items from the home remodel project. Only two left on the list. Embarrassingly, the remodel project was “finished” 15 years ago.


22:25 @danh
* Finished keypad guide.
* Still debugging RP2040 audio. I fixed one problem, but there is still some issue on the MacroPad. It appears to be some unwanted interaction with the display.
* 7.0.0-alpha.4 is imminent.


24:14 @david.glaude (lurking):
* Non CP
   * Tried out beta access for WipperSnapper on adafruit.io:
      * Project: Turn on LED of a Metro M4 when light level on PyPortal is High
      * Multi-ticket report on problems, features ideas, glitches, questions, ...
   * Further python code for the Buzz! Controler, now generate keyboard event with pynput: https://gist.github.com/dglaude/3536cc82e0273f12f7d9ff18817bbfa6


24:44 @foamyguy
* Last Week
   * Learned about Mid-Point circle algorithm and implemented a basic version in CircuitPython
   * Tried out beta access for WipperSnapper on adafruit.io 
   * Reviewing PRs for displayio.Group changes
* This week
   * Reduced time for CircuitPython - Teaching classes in the evenings
   * Continue with the displayio.Group PR reviews and testing
   * Trying to work out how to omit or include specific sections of a circle based on degrees


26:20 @hierophect (text only)
* Last week:
   * Finished sleep memory for the STM32
   * Basic sleep filename transition storage but it’s buggy
   * Moving/family/4th of July disruption
* This week
   * Fix filename storage across deep sleep
   * Test filename stuff across all ports
   * Make RTC timekeeping on STM32 more consistent
   * Import rebase of exception storage PR, double check sizes across small builds


@jasonp(lurking)


27:00 @jepler
* Last week:
   * Wrapped up camera code & guide
   * Started on calculator project
* This week:
   * Finish flash-size-savings “split type objects” PR
      * I thought the technical part was settled but there are problems with the “clang” C compiler (used on mac computers) and with “strict-aliasing” (which is an aspect of the C language standard)
   * Get back to calculator project
   * Check on guide feedback
* Other stuff:
   * Have to get the downstairs (my office & the guest room) tidied because we have overnight guests coming next weekend.


   * 

## 29:11 In The Weeds
@kattni : is anyone with macro pad running into display garbage?  It runs just fine and displys simple text for 10 minutes (or longer or shorter) and then everything gets garbled. It flikers and the text looks jumbled. Sometimes blinka is upside down.  It’s bizarre, and it’s done it on two of them.


## 34:21 Wrap-Up
