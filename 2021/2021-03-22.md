## 31:52 Status Updates


32:11 @jepler
Last week
* Bitmap & bitmaptools improvements with LOTS of help from Foamyguy and kmatch98 as I mentioned during Hug Reports.  What’s faster?
   * Loading pcf fonts.
   * Loading certain bitmaps with adafruit_imageload
   * Exchanging bitmap data (in & out) with array & buffer-like things, including ulab arrays
* Documented how to use the ROM USB bootloader on rt1010-evk & metro m7 rt1011
* Started working on the backlog of metro m7 bugs
* We made enough progress that ladyada announced it as “Coming Soon!”
* Made a minor bug-fix in pico-sdk, which they merged in today
* Made an experimental PR so that the frequency of a PulseIn can be set, to allow measuring longer pulses at millisecond precision instead of microsecond precision
This week
* Continue working on the backlog of metro m7 bugs
   * First items up: SPI, PWMOut, SDIO (which is on Teensy 4.1 but **NOT** on metro m7)
* Writing a guide page that will cover using the ROM USB bootloader mentioned above, part of the eventual metro m7 guide
* Maybe this week I’ll find time to add support for the “jmp pin” in rp2040? However, my direct need for it for the WWVB clock has passed
Fun stuff
* My WWVB clock is now a “dual processor” device -- it has a QT Py to do the low-level receiving work and a Feather RP2040 to do the high-level decoding work & running the display. They talk over a UART
* https://gist.github.com/09326b06f08bf9843d1e4c810d472a13 jepler_monotonic.py is a small module for creating an RTC from the time.monotonic_ns() time source, which can be set to sub-second accuracy.
* https://gist.github.com/jepler/05219cebd7e1144ed2233fe1cd67fc07 Implemented the RX-only UART using the PIO peripheral


35:24 @jerryn
* Last week
   * Did not succeed in adding a battery monitor to LYWSD03MMC - I clearly have no idea what I am doing with BLE… back to reading and will return to this at some point. 
   * Having an issue writing to neopixels on STM32F411CE BlackPill
      * “Color wheel” stalls occasionally -- can last for more than a second.
      * Created issue.
   * Found a problem with FingerPrint library with the newest sensor. Adding a slight delay to the “set_param” command fixes it. Not really sure why it occurs.
* Next week
   * Continue looking at both of the above issues.
* Fun        
   * Started moving 2 cord of firewood into the woodshed for use next Winter. First, had to move ½ cord of last years wood out… will use most of that this Spring.


38:18 @Jose David Montoya (Lurking, text only)
Last week
* Created the Styles Bundle, is ready for review if anyone could help me on that
* Reviewed the I2C peripherals after Scott review. We will need to put a hold on that as Raspberry pi Pico SDK does not have all the functions needed to do the slave read and I am not ready(willing) to do PIO.
* Last report on the 321 issue on the core.
* Bitmap_label PR to introduce directional text.
* Did a PR in the microplot library, that uses circuitpython or micropython to plot in a display adding the the feature to use Adafruit.shapes.Triangle as a scatter point
This week
* Styles library, if approved I can add the feature in other libraries to use it(widgets).
* Cartesian Plane widget. This will allow plot data from sensors. Inspired by the great work of kmatch98
Fun Stuff
* Happy that now I know what shared bindings means almost as happy as I was when I discovered what DHT stands for


39:37 @kattni
* Last week:
   * Finished up a big guide
   * Worked with FoamyGuy to get a reasonable minimum value, and Dylan to increase the duplicate code threshold on all the libraries to that value
   * Began the process of adding `LED` as a pin name to all CircuitPython boards with a little built-in LED
   * Began writing/applying templates to CircuitPython board guides
   * Added pinouts diagram to Feather RP2040 guide (thanks Bill!)
   * Sorted out dealing with getting the tests in the datetime library passing
   * Updated the CLUE guide to include debug pin pad info
   * Fixed the BNO08x guide to refer to the lib package instead of .mpy
   * Started CYBERDECK Bonnet fritzing object
   * Started CYBERDECK HAT and Bonnet guide
   * Various PRs etc.
   * Final training on publishing the newsletter
* This week:
   * Publishing the newsletter solo for the first time
   * CYBERDECKen guide
   * Add code to started-but-never-finished MIDI FeatherWing guide
   * Continue with template pages for CircuitPython board guides


44:06 @kmatch
Widgets available: Button, ProgressBar, SwitchRound, IconWidget, Dial 
Last week
* Submitted Annotation widget
* Submitted Animated subclass for IconWidget
* Minor extension to readinto to support speedy graphic bitmap loading
* Added some getters/setters to give options for bitmap Palette manipulation
* Wrote some functions required to allow palette animations/color cycling of OnDiskBitmap
This week
* Submit FlipInput selector widget
* Debug displayio.tilegrid bug in dirty rectangle tracking with transposed axes
* Understand strategies for managing memory use in a scrolling text box 


45:47 @MakerMelissa
* Last Week:
   * Worked on Misc. GitHub issues and PRs
   * Started working on trying to develop a plugin based on Circup
   * Decided to try and build a lot of the functionality into a central place, so started working on modifying adabot to generate a JSON file with all the library info.
   * Saw this as an opportunity to build functionality for a dynamic bundle builder
   * Realized I needed to also have the unzipped files available on Amazon S3 to do this, so started poking around with the existing bundle builder libraries. 
   * Familiarizing myself with the internal workings of Adabot and CircuitPython-Build-Tools
   * Still confounded by how the release assets are actually attached to the bundle release, since they appear to be built by CircuitPython-Build-Tools, yet it doesn’t ever appear to be called by adabot
* This Week:
   * Continue working on dynamic bundler and hopefully have something to show for it very soon
* Fun Stuff:
   * Built a video accessory clamp bar and have a video of it [on my YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/ms9RoYNn-RA)


47:36 @Mark(Gamblor) (text only)
* Updated PIO ASM to implement all the mov operators
* On vacation for 2 weeks and can’t go anywhere so if anyone needs help / ideas on something that should be worked on let me know


47:56 @tannewt
* Sent out flash PR for RP2040
* This week will be odds and ends before switching to BLE workflow. May include:
   * Hooking nvm.toml into iMX RT build.
   * Refining the library READMEs to get pre-commit info in there.
   * Reducing command line length of RP2040 build so it works on windows
   * Ensure the pico-sdk settings work for our boards

* Released 6.2.0-beta.4 on Thursday.
* Did a bisect to find the commit that’s causing REPL startup delays on nRF. @hathach will debug further.
* Following and commenting on RP2040 I2C fixes.
* Studied AWS services further to help automate CircuitPython download log processing. Will be using AWS CloudTrail (structured logging) and AWS Athena (SQL queries over arbitrary data).
* Looking at rotaryio code to figure out why counts are missed occasionally, first noticed and worked on by @nmorse. The literature is all over the place. Found a much simpler technique which may work well.

* Testing the copy from ulab.array to displayio.bitmap
* Playing with thermal camera, trying to increase the FPS:
   * M4 and S2 on Keyboard Featherwing
* Trying to use the same code (“I Voted!” badge by Liz) as is on Feather M4 express, nRF52840, STM32 and S2.
* Mapping FeatherS2 to make code for FeatherM4 to work with limited change (see “In the Weed”)
* Helping Michael Horne with I2S on Pico: https://www.recantha.co.uk/blog/?p=20950
* Bad/Good news: My Feather RP2040 was DoA (only runs 30 seconds every few hours, enough time to flash, but I never see CircuitPython drive). RMA is on its way.


53:52 @foamyguy
* Last week
   * Working on Touch Deck project
   * Caught up and reviewed the display_text PRs that were outstanding
   * Created a helper class for the 3.5” FeatherWing and carried out some other refactoring in the FeatherWing library to satisfy the actions checks.
   * Testing out enhancements to bitmaptools, imageload, and some new widgets in the displayio_layouts library
   * Made an example script that reads from two different stemma compatible sensor breakouts and outputs data from them to the new dial gauge widget
   * Created an issue documenting an issue with the STMPE610 driver getting locked up
* This week
   * Finalize the code and add Touch Deck to the learn guide repo. Finish up the code walkthrough page in the Touch Deck learn guide
   * Further customize my own Touch Deck layers and print the enclosure.
   * Test and review IconAnimated, Annotation, and Cartesian from the newer PRs in displayio_layout library
   * Create simpletest example scripts for IconWidget and IconAnimated.
   * Clean up the CPython library, change it’s name to include colorsys. See if there is anything further needed for it to be bundle-ready.
   * Look into the new “Styles” library that Jose is working on.


56:39 @hierophect
* Last week:
   * Finally tracked down a problem with write access that was plaguing my deep sleep PR for STM32
   * Reviewed the AudioPWMIO PR for STM32, though I had issues with the SPI conflict that tyomitch identified in testing
* This week
   * Wrapping up cleanup of my STM32 power PR
   * Investigate the UDP issue Anecdata found
   * Start on low power for the RP2040


## 58:04 In The Weeds


@jepler
Consider enabling “external” modification of bitmaps, in a way that requires manual tracking of the dirty rectangle -- see https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/4403#issuecomment-803370195
Pro: may help with fancy animations
Con: Such users might be better served by directly accessing the TFT, not using displayio
Con: new responsibility for coders who use this feature to avoid incorrect display


Plan: Add a method to Bitmap to add a new area to the dirty region.


1:03:09 @Jose David (lurking text only)
* Do we have a minimum standard for the example code libraries? https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_DHT/pull/68
* Some example code use Capital letters for `static` variables others do not
* Some use high level Python techniques as using lambda functions, and other advanced Python techniques, and others try to be as simple as possible. 
* Do we have minimum requirements or is it to the reviewer criteria?
* Two things that we disable in pylint for examples: invalid name and doc strings. Names is disabled to allow the example author to make their own capitalization choices.
* Simpletest should be simple and easy to verify that the library/hardware is working. Other examples can be advanced. One library has an advanced example folder to segment them.
* Only requirement is that example names are prefixed with the library name. `dht_<name>.py` for example.
* Include comments in advanced examples to make things clearer.

1. Pin uniformity
Feather from Adafruit use (mostly) the same pin name for the same position.
FeatherS2 is different, at least for pins on one side, this make running code for the M4 more difficult without modification.


I made a file ‘remap.py’:
```python
import board as org_board
D5 = org_board.IO33
D6 = org_board.IO38
D9 = org_board.IO1
D10 = org_board.IO3
D11 = org_board.IO7
D12 = org_board.IO10
D13 = org_board.IO11
I2C = org_board.I2C
SPI = org_board.SPI
```

I use that by replacing “import board” by “import remap as board” like this:
import remap as board # this remplace “import board”


Q1: Is there a better way (something in board)?
Q2: Is the physical pin not such a bad idea https://github.com/pimoroni/physical_feather_pins?
Q3: What if the original board does not define I2C and SPI, is there a standard/recommended way to create the singleton the way board does?
* @danh - Pico board.I2C() was discussed in https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/4121
* Libraries should always optionally take in pin and bus objects instead of relying on the singleton objects.
* Pins can have multiple names in `board`. The first entry should match the silkscreen and then others can match the “pinout” naming (like feather) even if they aren’t labeled as such.


2. Can we have a requirements.txt for learn guide?… I could then use circup to get the right libraries for a specific project.That could be an easier target than creating a zip file per project.
   1. being discussed in https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython-org/issues/491


1:18:37 @MakerMelissa
I’m not sure who put together the bundle system, but would like to learn more details about the process itself.


* Adabot creates a release that triggers GitHub actions to build the assets based on the config here:   https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/.github/workflows/release.yml#L38
* Scott set it up originally so ask him with questions.
