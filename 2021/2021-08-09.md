### 3:20 Raspberry Pi Rolls Out New Documentation Online


Until recently, documentation for the non-Pico Raspberry Pi boards was on GitHub in GitHub Markdown language. As of Monday August 9th, a [new documentation site](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/) has been built and deployed directly from a [documentation repository](https://github.com/raspberrypi/documentation) using [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), when someone pushes to the **master** branch. However people will mostly be working on the **develop** branch in the repository, which is the default branch when you take a fresh checkout, and also the branch you should target for your [pull requests](https://github.com/raspberrypi/documentation/pulls) - [Raspberry Pi Blog](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/bring-on-the-documentation/).

* Everyone who participated in CircuitPython Day
* @warriorofwire and @foamyguy for working on fixing `vectorio` issues

## 24:12 Status Updates
24:34 @tannewt
* More fixes. Finally got my gdb happy again so fixing will relatively easier now.
* Working on a fix for reload while doing pulsein.
* xLooking at more issues to fix to get 7.0.0 out
* PRed the Adafruit BLE UUID’s to the Nordic numbers database so they’ll hopefully appear in nRF Connect in the future.
* Will be supporting BLE workflow apps in case they tickle any bugs.


26:14 @warriorofwire (text only)
* Tons of fixes, simplifications, ergonomic features and perf improvements in vectorio. (No more VectorShape!)

26:36 @AnneB (lurking)
* Please keep sending news, projects and tips to cpnews(at)adafruit(dot)com


27:17 @danh
* Still more audio debugging, trying to fix “crackling” and sometimes hanging audio. The sample rate makes a huge difference when it should not be an issue. Instrumenting timing of interrupts and buffer fills, and cases where the buffer filling is behind.


29:03 @foamyguy
* Last week
   * Wrapped up the remaining max_size and OnDiskBitmap updates in learn guide code with much help from @lesamouripoupre
   * Worked on two enhancements for GridLayout: lookup contents by x,y position, and divider lines between the cells
   * Helped make the Gauge widget “updatable” so that it can redraw itself when the progress has been set
* This week
   * Start working on PWMOut and the other remaining updates needed for breaking changes in CP7
   * Adapt the Dial widget to use the new simplified vectorio API
   * Hopefully finish up the divider line functionality for GridLayout and get a PR submitted.
   * Cleanup boundry_fill code and submit PR to core
   * Try out some other ideas to improve drawing efficiency in the Gauge and use cookiecutter to get a repo created for it.


30:55 @jepler
* Last week:
   * Uploading camera images to Adafruit IO guide
   * Implemented `circup install --auto` to install all libs required according to `findimport` python library
   * Implemented `qrio` for scanning QR codes, thanks to a C library called `quirc`
   * Pull requested random bugfixes into adafruit_circuitpython_midi
* This week:
   * Scanning QR codes guide
* Plenty of misc


32:52 @jerryn
* Experimented with the qr code reader for ov2640
   * Tried to port it to the rp2040 pico, but not enough RAM
* Hope to try the ov2640 webcam on a saola-wrover this week.
* Fun -- Took the dive into 3d printing. -- will spend much of today(next week) assembling/testing.


34:14 @kattni
* Last week:
   * Updated PCF8235 and DS3231 guides to include the STEMMA QT version
   * Significant template cleanup involving:
      * Moving code around to be BundleFly compatible
      * Also so it generates the dynamic CIRCUITPY contents “screenshot” image
      * Updated some of the template pages to use the dynamic images
      * Updated all the related links to moved code
      * Updated examples to use `rainbowio` etc so it’s a single example in the template instead of a separate example for every guide using the template
   * Finalised the code side of my MacroPad shortcuts example, still thinking about what I want the shortcuts to be specifically - open to suggestions! It’s a GitHub “text expander” setup where it’s common phrases used on GitHub, such as the LGTM key sends “Looks good to me.” and the TFYC key sends “Thanks for your contribution!” etc. What common short phrases do you send in GitHub issues and PRs?
   * Created a PR to the Learning System Guides repository renaming all instances of `main.py` to `code.py`, to prepare for updating the associated guides - PR not yet merged as it will break 30+ guides, and I am waiting until I have Dylan’s help to update the guides once merged.
   * Hosted a CircuitPython Day Chat with Kattni, Jeff and Dan on Friday - we went the full 2 hours because of all of the amazing participation by the community asking questions and so on. Thanks again to Bruce for the assistance with tracking the various chat avenues.
* This week:
   * MCP9601 guide - similar to the old version, but not enough to include in the existing guide, so it’ll get a new guide.
   * Possibly do the main.py->code.py update in Learn depending on Dylan’s availability
   * Continue thinking about what I want my MacroPad project shortcuts to be
   * Potentially do a NeoKey Trinkey guide to send timestamps from OBS into a document for keeping timestamps in notes during streams
   * Various miscellaneous
   * More template stuff.


37:42 @MakerMelissa
* Last Week:
   * Out sick much of the week. Fortunately not Covid, but still felt awful.
   * Worked on MacroPad guide and finished up the code and started writing the guide
* This Week:        
   * Finish up my guide
   * Possibly start on another guide
* Other Stuff:
   * Moving all my work stuff into a new office to make more room in my home and not have to constantly reconfigure everything
