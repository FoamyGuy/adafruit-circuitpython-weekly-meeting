Overall: We’ve been seeing a lot of documentation updates, but that is drawing to a close.  There have been quite a few contributions to the community bundle lately, with multiple libraries added recently.  We’re working on moving certain libraries over to the circuitpython organization on github; we want to integrate the information about those repos on circuitpython.org so it remains just one place to find information.

@anecdata (lurking)


33:35 @danh (not at meeting)
   * Finished the dynamic USB descriptors PR, which was merged. There were some bugs, and I have PRs in to fix those.
   * Verifying that adafruit-board-toolkit is not working on M1 Macs, which causes the board detection I added to Mu recently not to work. Neradoc has fixes; I will set these in motion.
   * Thinking about how to make some kind of recovery UF2 in case someone has turned off both MSC and CDC USB devices: could be safe mode or could be a filesystem eraser. I have a draft PR but this is still a discussion topic.
   * Will be bug-hunting for 6.x and 7.0.0.


34:18 @David.Glaude (not at meeting)
   * Continue to work on Thermal Camera, with one code.py that work on multiple hardware with various bilinear interpolation scaling and displayio scaling: PyPortal, Clue, Matrix Portal and FeatherWing Keyboard + FeatherS2 or Feather RP2040. https://twitter.com/DavidGlaude/status/1391752583912493060?s=20
   * Testing the new ‘Pico to Zero’ v0.4 with Pull-up resistor.

   * Last Week:
   * Adding support for the latest RISCV boards to PythonPlatformDetect and about to push changes to blinka.
   * This Week:
   * Continuing the translation of the CircuitPlayground guide
   * Stalking any missing translations to spanish via Weblate API :)


35:13 @foamyguy
   * Last week:
   * Finish up the majority of the updates to learn guides to change the way SPI and I2C are accessed from busio to board.
   * Created a 1 minute video that tells folks about the new requirement screenshot utility
   * Worked on changes to CookieCutter for adding “Org” to the circuitpython org projects it generates, and a fix for pip installation instructions for non-adafruit projects
   * This week
   * Getting spun up for the blog system, and writing first blog post for the requirement screenshot video
   * Finish up the last of the busio -> board updates in learn guides
   * Complete the changes in CookieCutter for circuitpython org
   * Polish up the PyPortal screen design / management server and get it deployed online somewhere so other folks can make use of it with their own PyPortals.


36:38 @hierophect
   * Last week
   * Fixed issues with the supervisor run reason, so it now identifies correctly when it was reloaded from the REPL, the supervisor, an auto reload, or startup, as opposed to just reporting auto reloads for everything
   * Fixed an issue with the Espruino Pico, which is neither an ESP nor a Pico, but a very tiny STM32 board
   * Did an overview Adafruit Neopixel implementation based on some user feedback and fixed a minor bug
   * Fixed some issues with the RP2040 deep sleep implementation that I ran into during testing
   * Started on the next startup file code.
   * This week
   * Review Scott’s new status LED code and make sure it plays nice with Sleep
   * Catch the STM32 Alarm up to date with main branch (again)
   * Start merge process for the general internal sleep revamp, which should also involve some cruft cleanup in the NRF alarm system and things of that nature
   * Keep catching up on the set-next-file PR, get that fixed up and submitted
   * Finish Alarm power profiling project with example code
   * FunStuffs
   * Ported the first three chapters of Genki into my Circuitpython flashcards app


39:10 @Hugo (Lurk/listen only)
   * Last week
   * More work on rebranding, including templating and globbing 
   * Help out @danh and @Neradoc with M1 Mac USB/Serial diagnosis
   * This week
   * Finish up rebranding


39:27 @jepler
   * Last week & today:
   * Helping out with test fixing during the merge process
   * Made some short videos for the adafruit blog
   * Contributed a fix to the UTF-8 BOM problem with findimports for the CIRCUITPY drive screenshot maker
   * Contributed some fixes for obscure C compliance bugs to micropython
   * Worked on some ulab build failures 
   * Worked on the “natmod” (native code in .mpy files) examples, they all now _build_ for x86_64, and some of them work.  Understanding more about the limitations of natmod, I’m not sure how useful it is.  At this time I don’t think we plan to actually enable it; it takes space in the flash firmware, so we can’t really use it as a way to expand the capabilities of the very low-end M0 boards.
   * Got Espressif’s demo for the camera on the Kaluga working, though there are some problems with the hardware & the images exhibit banding and sometimes corruption.  Can study it for the Python implementation
   * This week:
   * More merge help if needed
   * Maybe making the CIRCUITPY drive screenshot maker work on examples from the bundle
   * Maybe RGBMatrix support for ESP32-S2
   * Maybe camera support for ESP32-S2
   * Will miss the next _TWO_ monday meetings, taking a road trip.  Will be doing lots of walking & light hiking near Boulder CO.


41:46 @jerryn
   * Lots of testing of 7.0 with the mp merges -- most cases working very well
   * Found an issue with usb_hid ( USB Busy error)  -- now fixed py pending PR from danh
   * Ran into a confusing issue (first on pirkey_m0) but reproducible on CPX
   * Involves use of irremote and usb_hid..I think...
   * New issue opened. https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/4738


43:20 @Jose David (Text Only)
   * Last Week:
   * Most of the time working in libraries Open issues.
   * Reviewing some PRs from new folks
   * Reviewing Gyros/Accel libraries. Verify that we were returning SI units. Changes were made in three libraries 
   * This Week
   * Continue working in Open Issues and Reviewing PRs






## 43:57 In The Weeds
44:13 @Jose David:
   * Library size vs boards. See https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_LSM6DS/issues/15
Sensor libraries with a lot of features will raise a memory allocation error. In the issue above Scott mention a possible check, is this something still in plan or we mention that in this caveat in the readme file of some of the libraries, as in:
https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_DPS310/pull/13
Another solution is presset some libraries with default values and avoid class build usage and all the registers in the libraries. But maintainability having two versions could be cumbersome. Comments or Ideas?

   * Sphinx update? - check libraries. Core is pinned. mystparser instead of recommonmark
   * 52:42 Template for library PRs - add to the CI update.

   * For circuitpython org repos do we want the “Org” to be included in the pypi name, readthedocs name, and the name of the .py file
