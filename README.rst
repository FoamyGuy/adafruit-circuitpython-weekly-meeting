CircuitPython Weekly Meeting Notes
===================================

Each week, members of the CircuitPython community meet on [the Adafruit Discord] to discuss all things CircuitPython. The meetings are recorded and made [available on YouTube]() with links to notes in this repo. These notes include time codes to specific sections of the video so that one can only listen to portions of interest.
