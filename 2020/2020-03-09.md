## 11:03 State of CircuitPython, Libraries and Blinka
### 11:32 Overall
* 43 pull requests merged
  * 20 authors - jimbobbennett, theacodes, iraytrace, makermelissa, jerryneedell, Marius-450, ladyada, kattni, dherrada, sommersoft, arturo182, brentru, FoamyGuy, tannewt, hierophect, caternuson, mfeif, fgallaire, jepler, danlove99

* 13 closed issues by 8 people, 17 opened by 12 people


Overall:  We released CircuitPython 5.0 stable.  It’s now out there, so update all of your projects and if you find any problems let us know.  File an issue, talk to us on Discord.  And if it works, let us know that too.


In terms of libraries, we continue to get more libraries and I’ve seen a lot of activity on current issues and PRs so thank you to everyone who has recently joined up and is continuing to work on that.  One of the things we wanted to do this year is not let PRs languish, and we’ve decreased that significantly.  Thank you for that.

      * Not perfect -- but further improvement may mean a substantial rewrite.
      * Discuss in weeds if desired.
* Next week
   * Submit PR for RFM69 and then apply same to RFM9x if approved
      * Consider more substantial revision including C code FIFO


37:00 @kattni

@mrcertainly (lurking) 


@sdw_nj (lurking)




43:55 @siddacious - text only, please read
* Working on ICM948 CP libs; Arduino mostly done and CP getting close. Both are refactored versions of the ICM20649 lib and will be renamed to ICM20X
* Off Thurs/Fri for Birthday staycation
44:30 @siddacious - text only (hug reports)
* Radomir for code review and Python advice
* CGrover for more circuit analysis and component selection advice
* OSHWA and Adafruit for providing guidance and support in making wise travel choices




45:03 @sommersoft (text only)
* Last Week:
   * Libraries:
      * Patched GitHub Actions build.yml files to move pip installs of pylint, black, and Sphinx+theme back to each repo from the centralized actions-ci script.
      * Patched .pylintrc to add 'bad-continuation' in preparation for black code formatting
      * Tried to patch the CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md files, but apparently there has been a lot of drift and 3 separate git patch files couldn't reach 100% coverage.
   * RosiePi/physaCI:
      * HTTP Signature authorization now working. Made the first successful request from physaCI (Azure) to a RosiePi Node (RPi on my network)!!!
* This Week:
   * Finish up the skips from patching .pylintrc (~8 repo PRs)
   * Work on a script to update all of the CoCs by copying in the new version regardless of the current version.
   * Further research adabot using boto3 for core metrics in AWS.
   * Look into Blinka contributors not being included in the Overall stats in adabot daily report. Totally forgot about this last week.


46:20 @tannewt
* Fixed up the Radio library. Need to rename it to adafruit_ble_radio. (thanks to foamyguy for the reminder and cater for the help)
* Made good progress on sleeping on nRF52840. Feather with NeoPixel lasts ~4 time longer on a single charge. Need to run the same test with CPB which can turn NeoPixels off.
* Need to add/fix the other ports for the sleep rework.
* Need to fix whatever it breaks. (audio playback probably and definitely PulseIn)
* Definitely want to target sleep for after ulab stable. Sleep may break lots of things. Everything needs to be interrupt driven.
* If anyone wants to make a CI test for import size of libraries that would be awesome.
* Hanging out at home since Covid-19 is around the Seattle area. No NYC travel (which I said last week.) May stream later in the week either CP sleeping or TinyLogicFriend. Everyone stay healthy and sane. Happy to do video chats if folks need it.


@v923z (lurking)


53:09 @AndrewTribble
* This Week:
   * Spent a brief time researching i2s audio in response to a question from @SpikeyBoi, specifically using the SPH0645LM4H as an input device
   * Continued testing of the lightning AS3935 lightning sensor chip using a SwitchDock Labs AS3935 “Thunderboard”
   * Continued Discord community support when possible
* Next Week: 
   * Assistance with PyCon preparation
   * Continued Testing and possibly even documentation of the CircuitPython AS3935 Library depending on how much work is left to do
   * Possibly begin playing around with my Cricket for Micro:bit using my Clue
   * Continued Discord community support when possible

@geekguy (lurking)


1:02:53 @hierophect
* Last week:
   * PulseIn, getting a proper control setup working and adding exti support without messing with any of the existing interrupt stuff on STM32
   * H7 and F7 research, investigating new boards, working on pin and register differences from the F4 series, how much work is required for new features and advanced drivers that take full advantage of the F and H7 capabilities. 
* This week:
   * Mostly more of the same:
   * PulseIn wrapup and PR
   * RotaryIO control and implementation
   * H7/F7 structural changes and SoC additions, starting with the H743
   * Working with Zephyr rtos people to improve board import docs etc
   * May be moving my base of operations for the short term, still evaluating based on Boston COVID cases


## 1:06:57 In The Weeds
* 1:07:30 Rename adafruit_radio to adafruit_ble_radio - @kattni will do it
* 1:07:53 @tannewt: 5.1.0 release plan
   * @v923z how does ulab factor in here? Additional functions? 
   * @jepler will enable on other 2 ports
   * @v923z will move spectrum to extra, @jepler will update our documentation
   * @jepler - we created adafruit circuitpython ulab - should we deprecate this?
      * @tannewt - fine to point upstream
      * @jepler - will pull request to change .gitmodules to point upstream
      * @tannewt - will arrange to archive the circuitpython-ulab repo
   * @v923z - where should people file issues/feature requests? Can you provide some publicity to this?
      * @tannewt - loop @v923z in on release notes
* 1:23:00 @jepler: What is the connection between pylint continuations and black
   * @kattni - Long-standing bug in pylint where it fails on PEP8 compliant continuations with kwargs. Black formats it to that continuation, and pylint fails even though it’s valid. So we’re disabling it in pylint.
