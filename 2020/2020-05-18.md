Overall (@tannewt): Things are going really well, we’re seeing new people come in and I think we as an existing community are doing an excellent job at welcoming newcomers.  Let’s remember to prioritize that and keep it as a focus.  As we level up more people and get more reviewers, it means we can support more developers.  On the technical side, we have a beta release and a stable release.  Please test the beta if you have time.  Libraries have been groomed really well by Kattni recently, thank you.  We’ve seen more contributions to the community bundle too.  As for Blinka, @makermelissa is doing a great job and reached 50 boards this week.

## 19:16 Hug reports

19:57 @tannewt
* @dherrada for tackling pyi doc conversion and follow up improvements.
* @polkapolka and @omsai for sprinting on CircuitPython on Saturday.
* @jepler for setting up Weblate. Nice to see new translators contributing.
* @flameeyes for the RFC around adding machine verifiable license info.


20:59 @v923z
* Group hug

@anecdata (lurking)


21:25 @anneb (lurking)
* Hug report to all who have sent in items for the Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! Please continue to tag #CircuitPython on Twitter or email subject News to anneb(at)adafruit.com.


21:50 @brentru
* @MakerMelissa for BLE Web Dashboard, used it for the first time. It’s great
* @jerryn for working on updating our LoRa learn guides with updated code he wrote


@cater (lurking)


22:30 @charlesburnaford
* Group hug for everybody. 
* Got an order from Adafruit, much appreciated!


22:55 @danh
* @ladyada for switching Learn Guides repo CI to GitHub Actions. It was a big slog and a big cleanup of technical debt, too.
* @jepler for Weblate integration, which promises to make translations much easier.
* @hathach for decoupling the nRF bootloader from the nRF SoftDevice, which means it will be much easier to update the version of the SoftDevice, or stop using it altogether. We can also package the SoftDevice and CircuitPython together in one UF2.


@davep (lurking)

24:37 @david.glaude (lurking):
* @danh for the adafruit_ble_adafruit, great to have this in CP rather than Arduino.
* @MakerMelissa for the BLE web dashboard.
* @danh for trying to do _bleio in Blinka, it will be great to talk BLE between Pi and microcontroller.
* @CGrover for the Clock_Builder, make me want to build a clock.


@Duewester (lurking)


25:29 @foamyguy
* @Deshipu for ugame and stage libraries. Specifically ugame.buttons offering a cross platform way check for button presses

* @tannewt (Scott “Deep Dive” Shawcroft) for continuing to traverse the deep end of the pool.
* The whole Circuitpython team and community for being a helpful and great place to be


26:57 @hierophect:
* @arturo182 and @tannewt for reviews
* @arturo again for sending me a new i.MX feather for testing! Super cool!
* @MarkOllson for his VCP work


@IoTPanic (lurking)


27:47 @jasonp
* Group hug - thanks to all for quick support no matter what the topic.  
* Hug to whoever submitted the link for our new board two weeks ago


29:08 @jepler

* @V923z, I just sent them a weird bug this morning, and I’m looking forward to a swift resolution
* @cater for much helpful feedback on my guide in progress
* Discord moderators, there have been a lot of incidents lately with people joining the server just to cause trouble, and they have taken care of it
* @krayola for a chat about how to bring smart RGB LEDs and Displayio together.  We’ll make it happen!


31:05 @jerryn (missing meeting)

* @sommersoft for letting me bounce Sphinx issues off of him and helping me sort out what my issue was.
* @jepler for setting up Weblate to make translations of CircuitPython easier, and for taking notes in the meeting this week.
* @danh for getting the code working to use the CPB with the Bluefruit Playground app in CircuitPython
* @ladyada for cleaning up the Learn repo and getting it moved to Actions, looking forward to getting a lot of time back not waiting for the complicated Travis setup on it to run every time I submit Learn guide code
* @community moderators for keeping up with the new influx of moderation issues  - it was inevitable that it would happen as we grew, but that doesn’t make it any less important to recognise the moderators for all their hard work. Moderating is not easy to do, and everyone has been doing an amazing job.


@kingernorth (lurking)


33:33 @MakerMelissa
* @Tannewt for adding the CircuitPython.org board stubs. That sped things up.
* @Ladyada for moving Learn Repo to github actions. That one was probably the most complex repo.
* @Geekguy for his first Pull Request for PlatformDetect

35:50 @stargirl (offline)
* @tannewt for doing the PyCon mentored sprints. Scott does such a great job engaging newcomers.

## 36:10 Status Updates

37:16 @tannewt
* Got sucked into switching inline docs to pyi stubs. It’s merged in so heads up that the format has changed a bit. It’s basically normal python with … in place of the real implementation. We could switch away from rST now if we want.
   * NOTE: Links to modules and classes will change.
* Need to fix the RTD build. It doesn’t have the stubs because it doesn’t run `make stubs`
* ESP32S2 port is out for review. Will work on finishing digitalio next and then busio.


40:16 @v923z
* Last week:
   * Added approx sub-module to ulab; allows root finding, and function minimisation of arbitrary python functions, and interpolation of numerical data. Will merge it later today.
   * Python functions can be vectorised now
* For this week: 
   * Fixing Jeff’s mysterious bug 
   * adding non-linear least square fits to approx

@anecdata (lurking)


@anneb (lurking)


43:52 @brentru
* LW:
   * Released a new version of Adafruit_FONA, now has SMS
   * Working on a FONA+SMS sensor guide, out by Wed. 
      * Text the fona module which sensor reading you’d like -> module texts back
      * Python is incredible for parsing text, this project in Arduino is muuuch more complicated. 
* TW:
   * Finishing the FONA/SMS Guide
   * Add FONA3G compat. To FONA module

   * Non-Adafruit: Doing an independent study with a professor on ML over the summer, if anyone has good (textbook or MOOC/online course) resources plz let me know :) 


@cater (lurking)


45:13 @charlesburnaford
* I’m hoping, still on that same old project of trying to get velocity sensitive keys on my synthesizer.  It’s a royal pain.  I may ask some questions or for some suggestions.




47:15 @danh
* Released the `ble_adafruit` services library, and added pages to the Bluefruit Playground app guide and the Web Bluetooth Dashboard app guide about how to install the sample programs on the boards.
* Did a bunch of reviews.
* Minor new release of UF2 bootloader: v3.10.0. Adds pewpew_m4 board, fixes a very minor NeoPixel problem. No need to upgrade most boards.
* Cleaned up my desk in a major way. Added a small Windows dev machine (a refurb Dell micro Optiplex) for easier testing instead of using a laptop all the time.
* Starting to work on using bleak for _bleio, using @tannewt’s broadcasting work as a start. Studied up on asyncio.


@davep (lurking)

49:17 @david.glaude (lurking):
* This week
   * Adapted @CGrover PyPortal clock (Clock_Builder) to Adalogger FeatherWing (pcf8523)

@MrCertainly (lurking)



1:04:50 @sommersoft
* Last Week:
   * RosiePi:
      * Continued debugging OS lockups when putting a board into bootloader on Ubuntu & RPi 3B+. I've narrowed it down to using `microcontroller.reset`; double-tap is rarely affected. Without getting a full stack trace (kdump refuses to panic on softlock), I can only narrow it down to the RPi's USB driver not liking something. Having udev ignore all HID requests helped a little, but ultimately failed. RPi 4 on order, since e/xhci drivers seem much more tolerant…
      * Started on the webpage display of full test results. Reincarnated an older copy of a Jinja template from the prototype version, and used an Azure Function as an endpoint to serve it. It works, but is limited. So, started moving towards a full[er] web app solution. My days of avoiding JavaScript are coming to an end. :D
   * Did a little diving on @Flameeyes' REUSE licensing PR. Put up some thoughts on implementation and effects.
* This Week:
   * RosiePi:
      * Keep working on spinning up the web app to display full test results.
      * Wait for RPi 4 to arrive.


1:08:40 @stargirl (offline)
* Got the boards for Hostess from OSHPark and got it to boot (yay!), going to actually start testing this week.
* Programming, testing, and assembling ~50 Winterbloom Sols and ~100 Winterbloom Big Honking Buttons.

## 1:09:21 In The Weeds
1:09:52 @danh
* @tannewt, could you explain what the options about switching away from rST are? I see recommonmark and autoStructify, but I’m not sure how much of the `:py:blahblah` and `.. whatever` stuff would go away. Answer: A lot of the way we have to label, classes, methods, functions, and parameters could go away. Also we could consider moving library doc away from rST as well.


1:12:30 @jasonp
* Copyright best practices for customized CP builds
   * Saw a thread on this topic a while back, but I don’t recall the details
@tannewt: if you’re shipping  a version that came from adafruit master, you can call it circuitpython.  If you look in the readme there’s a branding section.  On the trademark side, if you have your own fork, your request is that you just NOT call it circuitpython.


@jasonp we have our own VID/PID, and will be pull requesting into CircuitPython


@tannewt that is fine


1:15:15 @v923z
* bringing ulab's documentation in line with circuitpython; what is required on my part?
   * Adding python stubs to ulab, will be updated by ulab maintainer.
      * @jepler will PR the stubs into ulab, and we’ll discuss it again if desired
* 1:24:55 adding numpy-incompatible functions to ulab for speed boost
   * @tannewt - don’t mix numpy-compatible and -incompatible modules, but otherwise it’s fine
* 1:28:22 How to supply data to print statements in C; printing text to any console, similar to exception messages (would be useful for additional output of fitting routines)? mp_printf


## 1:32:15 Wrap-Up
