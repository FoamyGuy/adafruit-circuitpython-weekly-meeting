Focus on the Adafruit CLUE Board

The Adafruit CLUE board contains a powerful Nordic nRF52840 microcontroller, a suite of sensors, and a color display on a board the size of a BBC micro:bit.
Here's a trio of articles from makers on using the CLUE board with CircuitPython.

Monday Microcontroller: Adafruit CLUE

Les Pounder takes a look at CLUE and provides comparisons to the micro:bit. He demonstrates how to code the board in Arduino and CircuitPython. Finally a review of the micro:bit add-ons that work with the CLUE - bigl.es and Twitter.

Using Bluetooth Between a micro:bit and Adafruit CLUE

Using Bluetooth to talk between a micro:bit and CLUE board in MakeCode and CircuitPython respectively - Twitter thread, CircuitPython Code and MakeCode.

And Using WiFi on an Adafruit CLUE

An Adafruit CLUE and a WiFi FeatherWing are bridged with a Pimoroni Pinbetween. This project uploads sensor stats to Adafruit IO - Twitter.

In this week's episode of Python Tea, host Nina Zakharenko talks talks with Thea Flowers. Thea has used CircuitPython on a number of projects including modular synthesizer modules sold by Winterbloom - Twitch.


5:44 OSHWA to update language usage.
The Open Source Hardware Association posts a resolution to redefine SPI pin names - OSHWA:
‌The‌ ‌words‌ ‌that‌ ‌we‌ ‌use‌ ‌have‌ ‌an‌ ‌impact.‌ ‌It‌ ‌is‌ ‌time‌ ‌to‌ ‌remove‌ ‌the‌ ‌words‌ ‌which‌ ‌describe‌ ‌a‌ ‌morally‌ ‌repugnant‌ ‌relationship,‌ ‌"Master"‌ ‌and‌ ‌"Slave",‌ ‌from‌ ‌our‌ ‌technical‌ ‌vocabulary.‌ ‌These‌ ‌terms‌ ‌have‌ ‌been‌ ‌used‌ ‌for‌ ‌decades‌ ‌to‌ ‌describe‌ ‌the‌ ‌relationship‌ ‌between‌ ‌hardware‌ ‌components.‌ ‌Some‌ ‌of‌ ‌the‌ ‌standards‌ ‌and‌ ‌interfaces‌ ‌that‌ ‌use‌ ‌this‌ ‌terminology‌ ‌include‌ ‌SPI,‌ ‌I2C,‌ ‌Wishbone,‌ ‌AXI,‌ ‌SD,‌ ‌RapidI/O,‌ ‌and‌ ‌MIPI‌ ‌DSI. By‌ ‌way‌ ‌of‌ ‌example,‌ ‌the‌ ‌SPI‌ ‌(Serial‌ ‌Peripheral‌ ‌Interface)‌ ‌protocol‌ ‌specifies‌ ‌logic‌ ‌signals‌ ‌with‌ ‌names‌ ‌including‌ ‌MOSI‌ ‌(Master‌ ‌Output‌ ‌Slave‌ ‌Input),‌ ‌MISO‌ ‌(Master‌ ‌Input‌ ‌Slave‌ ‌Output),‌ ‌and‌ ‌SS‌ ‌(Slave‌ ‌Select).‌ ‌This‌ ‌is‌ ‌unacceptable.‌

Overall: We’re working towards releasing CircuitPython 6.x. The move from 5.4.0-beta.1 to 6.x comes out of I2C renaming requiring a major version bump - expect to see a 6.x release this week. There’s much activity on the libraries including another issue sweep, and a ton of PRs with fixes and features. Blinka is seeing continued display support improvement. All of the activity across the entire project is great to see and continues to increase.

## 28:10 Status Updates
@anecdata (lurking)


43:50 @brentru
* Updated MiniMQTT to fix bug w/publishing payloads >127 bytes (also fixed QoS and retain flag bugs)
* Moving!


44:20 @cater                          
* Fixed a bug in ADS1x15 (ADC) library related to fast reads in continuous mode
* working on CLUE based altimeter for a Learn Guide                           
* working on a bitmap/MQTT sharing "whiteboard" project


46:08 @CGrover (text only)
* Working heads-down on a combined hardware/software scheme to automatically detect cables connected to Eurorack module jacks, useful for switching between the internal static preset or an external control signal. The current project has seven 10v analog input jacks, one digital-ish Gate input jack, and one analog output jack. Using an ItsyBitsy M4 Express to simultaneously inject a single polling pulse into all input signals then noting the change in the input measurement. The current code version is working reliably but needs to be optimized to get detection latency down from 15ms to 1ms or less. Will be experimenting with ulab today to see if that will help.
@charlesburnaford  (lurking)
@cjsieh (lurking?)


47:00 @danh (text only)
* Fixed several smaller BLE issues which are being found as we churn the libraries and more people are using them.
* Started on yet another implementation of _bleio, to support the HCI BLE protocol standard, used by ESP32 and other modules, and also used by USB dongles. Primary goal is to support BLEon AirLift-enabled boards. DId some refactoring to enable a second _bleio implementation in the circuitpython tree. Added _bleio.Adapter API to specify the pins needed to talk to the HCI adapter. Made an “empty” _bleio implementation which compiles, and am now working on first communication with the adapter.


@davep (lurking)


47:48 @DavidGlaude
* BLE Double Peripheral to Central Mouse code : https://gist.github.com/dglaude/a765ee9fe0aea6dc0f6298a8a734c2bb 
* Trying to make Feather Wing Enviro Plus works with STM 32
   * Added support for STM32F405 Express in “pimoroni / physical_feather_pins” in https://github.com/pimoroni/physical_feather_pins/pull/3
   * Replace time.time() by time.monotonic() in PMS5003 and LTR559 driver to work around the absence of RTC on STM32.
* Trying to replicate CLUE to FeatherWing AirLift by @wildestpixel (see newsletter) but currently fail on ESP32 "not responding" and "timed out on SPI select" so my wiring is likely wrong.
* Not 100% CP: Got interested in “Colour Maximite 2” (retro console) that run on a STM32 CoreH743I (so if CP work on that too it would be great)


@deshipu (lurking)


50:15 @foamyguy
* Fixing a few issues with the display_text library, max_glyphs and anchored_position
* Lots of work on JSON layout system. Now supporting display_shapes and display_button. Published online: https://github.com/FoamyGuy/circuitpython_display_layouts
* Brainstorming ways to test displayio based libraries.
* Diving into RosiePi and PhysaCI. Learning lots and setting up my first Raspberry Pi to use them.


52:23 @hierophect
* Last week:
   * Worked on some testing and bugfixes
   * Prototyped out a timer allocator for STM32
   * Reviewed timer differences between the F4 advanced/access lines, F7, H7
   * Viewed a lot of apartments
* This week
   * Wrap up timer allocator and new interrupt system
   * Work on timer related stuff (rotaryIO)
   * Spend a little more time on RGBMatrix
   * Continue to review and assist with progress on the F1


@JacobT (lurking)


28:40 @jepler
* Last week:
   * Got SDIO working on the SAM E54 devkit
   * Decreased the scope of the SD card pull request, and got it ready for review
* This week:
   * Any review requests on the SD PR
   * Background tasks, probably


28:43 @jerryn
* Not much to report -- work on squeezing rfm9x into the feather m0 is blocked by an issue with pulseio on the m0 boards. Will resume when it is resolved.
* Resolved a minor issue with building CP for the esp32s2 on Raspberry pi.
* Working on a very strange issue with trying to access an external SDCard reader when a TFT featherwing is also present. Still working with user who posted it on discord -- will post an issue if/when I can come up with a clear test case. More “in the weeds”


31:47 @jmarcelino
* New here, will be working on supporting RAK Wireless hardware on CircuitPython
* First is RAK5010 board which has nRF52840 + Quectel BG96 cellular 
* Then RAK4600 module which is nRF52832 + LoRa




33:25 @kattni
* Last week:
   * Started adding the ISM330DHCX + LIS3MDL FeatherWing to the ST Combo board guide including Overview, Pinouts, Downloads - the ISM330DHCX-associated libs needed a fix, so was waiting on that to finish the Arduino and CP/Python code pages.
   * Added note to the guide about the FeatherWing SCL/SDA pins being swapped on the silk and replied to a forum post that brought this to my attention
   * Updated my Circuit Playground Bluefruit NeoPixel Animation and Color Remote Control guide NeoPixel Animator code to match the updated LED Animation API - only the imports needed to be updated
   * Fixed a few bugs found in the LED Animation library while testing NeoPixel Animator code.
   * Updated guide to match code change
   * Verified with Melissa that we’re on the right track for getting all appropriate CircuitPython libraries on PyPI - the rest of the display libs that aren’t will be tested and a determination made, once tested successfully, Melissa will notify me and I will get them put on PyPI.
   * Added the STEMMA QT BNO055 breakout to the BNO055 guide, including Overview, Pinouts (same pins, different order), new fritzing diagrams for code pages, and Downloads.
   * Started the 74HC595 guide
   * Required assistance getting the wiring correct on the 74HC595 with 8 LEDs, but once that was fixed, wrote up code for a chase effect and blinking.
   * Misc - followed up on GitHub issues, etc.
* This week:
   * Finish the 74HC595 guide
   * Finish ST combo guide update
   * Move CircuitPython libraries from `master` to `main`
   * Get accounts set up to get PyPI download stats going again
   * Then: it’s a mystery!


@kjw (lurking)


37:32 @makermelissa
* Last Week:
   * Ported a good chunk of the PyPortal library over to Blinka
   * Optimized some of the Blinka displayio code by using native Pillow (full image) types and functions instead of pixel by pixel functions.
   * Fixed several libraries so they install correctly via PyPI.
   * Worked with Kattni to write the 1.3” TFT bonnet with Joystick guide
* This Week:
   * Working on speeding up displayio for Blinka some more by implementing dirty rectangle tracking.
   * Look into getting the Blinka PyPortal library working with Adafruit IO
   * Review some pending display related PRs
* Other:
   * Published my OpenSign library on github last week which is the python library I wrote to allow easy animations of RGB matrix signs driven by Raspberry Pi boards. It’s available at https://github.com/makermelissa/OpenSign or through PyPI.
   * Upgraded my PC case and installed some RGB LED fans that make cool animations.

@Mr. Certainly [lurking]


@noe (lurking)


39:24 @sommersoft
* Last Week:
   * Adabot:
      * Worked out how to transition away from pypistats.org for getting library download stats. Directly uses the Google BigQuery that PyPA supplies with information.
      * Put in a draft PR for a script that will move all of the library repos from 'master' branch to 'main' branch.
   * Core Docs:
      * Implemented the custom CSS for the "viewing outdated version" box that RTD generates for older versions (2.x, 3.x, 4.x, ...). PRs have been made to all version branches.
   * Core & circuitpython.org:
      * Implemented supplying built-in module support for each board on circuitpython.org board pages. This is the same info that is in the docs Support Matrix.


41:22 @stargirl
* Received 2,700 patch cables last week and I was finally able to ship all of Winterbloom’s pre-orders.
* Worked a bit on my new oscillator design - it’s making noise, yay!
* This week and beyond: getting ready to move across the country. 


42:11 @tannewt
* Got the ESP32-S2 busio PR out. Will follow up on it this week.
* Going to remove existing native networking APIs from 6.0.0 and chase down other deprecations.
* After that, will make a 6.0.0 beta and start on ESP32-S2 wifi.


@Timonsku (lurking)
## 56:00 In The Weeds
56:17 @jerryn 
* suggestions for troubleshooting a strange sdcard issue.
* 1:03:50 Possibly discuss linux crashing when disconnecting USB
   * Danh - it’s a kernel bug, I reported it:
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1871143


1:07:54 @brentru 
   * We utilize the list of measurement properties from the Adafruit Unified Sensor Library within CircuitPython libraries (https://circuitpython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/design_guide.html#sensor-properties-and-units). 
   * Should we add other properties from this library to the design guide, such as sensor name, resolution and min/max values?


 1:10:46 @danh 
* We have some deprecated API we wanted to remove in 6.0.0, specifically renaming some _bleio properties and changing the arg names of another function or two. However, some of these changes were added after 5.3.0. If we don’t have a 5.4.0 release, total removal will need to wait until 7.0.0, so the libraries can catch up. The alternative is to add conditional code to the libraries to test for old/new names.
This again brings up a question about libraries staying in sync with CircuitPython, and whether we should consider having bundles for CircuitPython <n>.x and <n+1>.x that differ.

* 1:13:48 I fixed several BLE libraries recently, and had to fix their doc builds. Blinka _bleio is now available, so sphinx attempts to import _bleio. This is partly good because it can now do checks on the _bleio API, but partly an issue because _bleio imports bleak, and it also uses type annotations and `from future import __annotation__`, which was added to Python 3.7.
I found the best thing to do was to add “bleak” to `autodoc_mock_imports` in docs/conf.py (and remove “_bleio” if it was present, and bump the Python version to 3.7.
Does anyone see an issue with this? If we start using type annotations in more places

  * @kattni - update them all if we’re going to update any. Go to 3.8

* 1:18:27 In https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython-org/issues/491, I proposed having a dynamic web-based bundle builder that could be used to create a custom bundle for a particular project or board. Such a bundle builder might even replace the static bundles we build now, and could also have selectors for more than one version of CircuitPython.
  * This was viewed favorably, and is a candidate project for someone to work on.

* 1:21:45 The _bleio HCI project is an example of supporting a particular device or class of devices across multiple ports. To do this, I created a new tree:
   `circuitpython/devices/<device_name>/{common_hal/<module_name>/,supervisor/}`
In this case:
   `circuitpython/devices/ble_hci/{common_hal/_bleio/,supervisor}`.
Keeping the structure similar to `ports/<port_name>/` seems to be working out. Generic touchio could be moved into this structure: right now it’s in shared-module.
TinyUSB also does something like this, due to similar/identical peripherals (“IP; intellectual property”) being used in different chip families.
