### 5:37 A CircuitPython Music Visualizer

A CircuitPython-based music and sound visualizer, built using the Adafruit CLUE board. The onboard microphone captures the ambient sound and the CLUE provides a visual representation of the frequencies it detects on the color display. The ulab library, similar to numpy, provides the fast fourier transform function which takes the sound data and provides the frequencies to display. Written in Japanese and English - STEAM Tokyo and Twitter.

@anecdata (lurking)


@anne (lurking)


@bd2dcore (assumed lurking)


@cater (lurking)


16:52 @danh (not at meeting)
* Week before 9/21:
   * Did draft release notes and most merges for beta.0 release.
   * Started guide on using HCI _bleio on Windows, Mac, Linux, and RPi.
* 9/21: first full day of vacation, had a bicycle accident on a rail trail, broke hip and elbow. Surgery on 9/22. Now at a fantastic rehab hospital, recovering very well, and getting great therapy. Will be doing some work as situation permits (e.g., therapies overlap with meeting today). Drumming up interest in CPy for assistive tech here :) .


30:50 @David.Glaude (lurking)
* Updating my PyPortal to beta-0 and attempt to run BLE on the build-in AirLift (failure because _bleio is not build into PyPortal, and maybe not the right NiNa FW)
* Working on a QR Clock on Matrix, but right now I only have this: https://twitter.com/DavidGlaude/status/1310194187405529089?s=20 
* Analyse of the various Matrix project to see what can run on my 64x64 without AirLift: https://gist.github.com/dglaude/25a8849c75b36d0c2b364c619ace661f 
* Non CP: Streaming “Colour Maximite 2”” with PiKVM streaming component: https://twitter.com/DavidGlaude/status/1309591292880576514?s=20 


31:55 @foamyguy
* Tinkering with displayio, coordinating with @kmatch98 looking into GridLayout helper.
* Got everything set up to hook up Feather M4 with one of the 64x32 RGB Matrixes, gawked at the pretty blinken lights display
* Push code to github, and work on finishing touches for multitasking guide. Aiming to wrap up this week. 
* Outside CP:
   * Class starting up in the evenings again
   * Crash course on QMK. If anyone has experience setting up custom matrix configuration would appreciate a chance to chat about it.


33:38 @hierophect
* Last week:
   * Implemented the ADC on the ESP32-S2
   * Started updating the ESP-IDF which should be in today
   * Got a little bogged down with a project of my own, a new circuitpython capable STM32 board called the Rook
* This week:
   * Finish ADC
   * Submit the DAC on the ESP32-S2
   * Probably check out TouchIO after that. Might need to order some parts for it?
   * Just kind of for fun, do some pitch research for Crypto and Camera modules
   * Also check out that port-type documentation thing I was going to look at
   * Review the deep-sleep API since I’d like to add that to STM32
* For fun
   * Getting certified on the Laser cutter, going to make a box that locks up my devices for a set period so I can dedicate some screenless time on the weekends.
   * Finish up Rook and get some orders from JLCPCB


@jasonp (lurking)

39:25 @jepler
* Last week:
   * Basic CAN PR pushed, supporting SAM E5x
   * Tested that @siddacious’s MCP2515 interoperates with the SAM implementation
   * Tested that I can snoop my car’s CAN bus
   * Added support for the “qtpy haxpress”,for those who want to add their own flash chip on the bottom side.  Allows the addition of _pixelbuf and long ints, among other neat stuff.
   * Chased a problem I’m seeing with a Feather nRF, Sharp Memory Display, and a big program -- didn’t resolve it yet.  Eventually locks up when re-loading the code. If anybody’s seen something like this, there’s an Issue that you can add your info on!
* This week:
   * Continuing to work on CAN, some API improvements from @siddacious, also working on the low level part for STM32 so that you’ll be able to add a CAN transceiver chip or breakout and interface with the CAN bus
   * Figuring out what my first QT Py project will be
* Reviews and stuff all the time


41:16 @jerryn
* Fixed an issue with the adafruit_fram library so it now works with the new 2/4 Mbit breakouts - minor change to expand address range.
* More testing of new features for the nrf24l01 library -- Now has some BLE functions added!
* Heads up to anyone with Monster_M4SK -- there is a fix in for the M4_eyes sketch  that fixes an issue with the latest  Arduino_JSON library -- now have to enable comments.


42:42 @kattni
* Last two weeks:
   * Out!
* This week:
   * Getting caught up.
   * QT Py guide.


45:25 @kmatch98
* Last week: Created a basic touch button grid arranger
* Trying out some additional features for Adafruit_CircuitPython_Display_Button to simplify usage
* Explored @foamyguy’s code for touch elements
* This week: Make a “Group tree explorer” for deciding which display elements could respond to a specific touch location 
* Other fun stuff: ordered an ESP32-S2 Saola demo board and a capacitive touch display, will check if parallel connection is working in CircuitPython or will default back to SPI. 


47:07 @MakerMelissa
* Last Week:
   * Finished converting a PiTFT Installer Script in Python.
   * Added command line arguments to it for complete automation.
   * Updated Slideshow library and added image alignment
   * Wrote MatrixPortal slideshow demo
   * Wrote a MatrixPortal guide and it’s now live
   * Updated circuitpython.org with new boards
   * Fixed bug in WebSerial 3D Model Visualizer web app for BNO055
* This Week:
   * Write another Matrix Portal demo for John Park
   * Test out SPI and TFT on the Jetson Nano
   * Update the Machine Learning guide with the Braincraft Hat
   * Possibly moving some functionality around in the MatrixPortal library without breaking anything
   * Possibly take a look at a PIL Text Sharp Memory Display slowness issue


@mdroberts (lurking)






48:38 @microDev
* Draft PR for deep sleep api
* Updating make translate script


@Mr. Certainly [lurking]


28:12 @tannewt
* Last week:
   * UF2 support for the ESP32S2, have a pull request out for it, as well as to the esp32 uf2 repo so we can release versions of the bootloader as well
   * Will write a 1-page guide for how to use, install, and add boards to it
   * That’ll be the basics for UF2 support
   * Reviews for deep sleep API, next-code.py, and others
* This week:
   * Taking a look at deep sleep more, looking to collaborate with MicroDev if that’s a good way to split it up
   * Want to do beta.1 -- a lot of stuff has come in (since beta 0) like tinyusb updates, new boards, etc.  “turn the crank” and get the release out by the end of the week
   * We should be more aggressive in making prereleases every two weeks and get our cadence up.
   * We should get to stable 6.0 - if we think we can recommend the beta releases, we should be confident it’s stable
   * Investigate bug reports


@v923z [lurking]
