### Python Leads the IEEE Top Programming Languages for 2020


  



It’s been a turbulent year since the last time IEEE Spectrum broke out the digital measuring tools to probe the relative popularity of programming languages. Yet one thing remains constant: the dominance of Python.


> Our default ranking is weighted toward the interests of an IEEE member, and looking at the top entries, we see that Python has held onto its comfortable lead, with Java and C once again coming in second and third place, respectively. Arduino has seen a big jump, rising from 11th place to seventh.


One interpretation of Python’s high ranking is that its metrics are inflated by its increasing use as a teaching language: Students are simply asking and searching for the answers to the same elementary questions over and over. But Python is frequently used professionally and in high-profile realms, such as machine learning, thanks to its enormous collection of high quality, specialized libraries - [IEEE](https://spectrum.ieee.org/at-work/tech-careers/top-programming-language-2020).


### ALICE the Robot
  

ALICE is a Kinect controlled FPV mini-mech powered by CircuitPython on an Adafruit Feather microcontroller. The skeleton is 3D printed on a MP Mini Delta printer - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/scottmonaghan/status/1285807221805375488).


## CircuitPython Day is 9-9-2020


  



Adafruit has chosen September 9, 2020 (9/9/2020) as the snakiest day of this year for CircuitPython Day! Much more to come on events and happenings to include a CircuitPython team livestream, collaboration with hardware and software folks, and highlighting all things Python and Python on Hardware. More information will be forthcoming. Ideas? Send them via email to circuitpythonday@adafruit.com.


### Adafruit Update


  



**Adafruit is shipping orders!**


Production is up and now is the best time to get the Adafruit you've been waiting for.


### Workshop clock
  

A workshop clock (with a pandemic-inspired what-is-today display) ready for its debut. No internet required and ready for the zombie apocalypse. Inspired by 
John Park's Metro Minimalist Clock project. Programmed in CircuitPython - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CedarGroveMakr/status/1286806325272252418). 


### Productivity Timer
  

Another Pomordoro-like timer device with Adafruit Feather components - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/blain3r/status/1287758601206018048).


> First time using CircuitPython and it’s awesome!

@warriorofwire [lurking late]


@ anecdata (lurking)


@Anne B (Lurking)


@cater (Lurking)


@CharlesBurnaford Lurking


47:44 @danh
* Still working on ATT (attribute) protocol for HCI _bleio. Skeletal code now compiles, and now I’m working on the attribute table and implementing the common_hal routines that add and references attributes.
* New board definition for an upcoming product (see Top Secret videos).
* Lots of reviews and issue follow-ups.
* Took some timing traces for NeoPixel timing on SAMD21/51 on Arduino/CircuitPython. I have a table of typical timings, and will see if some are out of spec. Some people have had issues with WS2813 RGB LED’s (Adafruit doesn’t sell those).


49:50 @DavidGlaude (lurking)
* Upgrading many of my boards to 6.0.0 alpha 2 and latest library.
* Still some work on air quality sensor resolving a disagreement between pylint and black.
* Convinced the maker of Commander to add gamepad to his board (PR accepted by @danh) … and now I want countio.


@deʃhipu (Lurking)


@dherrada (Lurking)


@fede2 (Lurking)


50:54 @ foamyguy
        Last week:
* Cleaned up, documented, and published a Productivity Timer I made for Circuit Playground a while back.
* Testinting a few shapes and display_text PRs.
* Implemented ProgressBar with vectorio Polygons but then realized it’s not backward compatible with 5.x. Plan to create a new Vector_ProgressBar for now.
* Played with Kittenbot IO Bit and CLUE together
* Created a Circuit Python day countdown for PyPortal 
* 3D Printed heart shaped “Neon” Neopixel strip holder
* Built the circuit for, and tested a PR that added support for older MCP23016 IO Expander IC..
Next Week
* Teaching Javascript class 2 nights a week for a few weeks.
*  Work with Kmatch98 on updating the display_text documentation with the learn guide page.
* Play with displayio.Shape some more 


53:36 @hierophect
* Last week:
   * Wrapped up PWMOut on the ESP32-S2, fixing a duty cycle bug and some other nitpicks
   * Finished the Timer PR for STM32, after verifying that everything worked properly across RGBMatrix
   * Reviewed and tested Jeff’s SDIO PR
   * Read the documentation for the ESP32-S2 Remote Control peripheral, which I’ll be implementing as PulseIO this week. 
* This week
   * Keep working on ESP32-S2 PulseIO
   * Support development of the flash module on the STM32F1
   * Investigate SPI issue appearing on STM32 
   * Other bugfixes roundup


## 56:26 In The Weeds
56:50 @jerryn
* Moderation on Discord has become much more challenging with “Server Discovery” - It was noted last week that the issue has been raised with Adafruit. Looking forward to hearing more about this. What are the pros/cons for having it?
* @kattni - We spoke with PT. We can discuss it here.
   * Talking with Discord first as this is a bigger issue.
   * Considering removal from Discord Server Discovery
   * In the meantime we will do some more steps to circumvent bad actors


1:22:58 @v923z
* Where do we stand with ulab documentation?
* Generally, could documentation be generated on a per module basis? (to save time and other resources)
   * Check the sphinx-build flags to remove the one that causes a full rebuild. It’s good to do before committing because sphinx-build isn’t perfect.


1:22:15 @danh
* Summary about `board.I2C()` vs `busio.I2C()` (requested by @jepler): We added the default `board.I2C()` singleton creator to CircuitPython well after many Learn Guides were written. We’ve seen user confusion about whether one can use both `board.I2C()` and `busio.I2C(board.SCL, board.SDA)` in the same program. To avoid this confusion, more Learn Guides could be changed to use `board.I2C()`.

Idea that just occurred to me: we could also make `busio.I2C(board.SCL, board.SDA)` reference the singleton, instead of just failing. … A better idea is just to have `busio.I2C(board.SCL, board.SDA) throw an exception with a more explanatory error message. @danh will open an issue for this. 

Another minor discussion issue is related to this include allowing setting the baudrate or frequency when creating `board.I2C()`, .SPI()`, and `.UART()` for the first time.


1:32:00 @hierophect
   * might be worth mentioning that @jepler and I started an issue for board.SDIO, are there any other devices that might be worth supporting in this way?
