@anecdata (lurking)


@AnneB (lurking)


38:51 @brentru, text-only
* Worked on a PyPortal Titano Planter Guide with Noe and Pedro, should be live by wed!
* Working on CircuitPython_W5k, a pure-python ethernet module implementation
   * Currently working with the W5500 (Ethernet Featherwing), but has boilerplate’d code for adding different w5k family chips.
   * EthernetManager will be a high-level wrapper for this module
   * After this, I’ll be modifying requests and minimqtt to dynamically select which network manager you’ve passed it.


@cater (lurking)


39:39 @CGrover (text only)
* Published the PyGamer Thermal Camera learning guide.
* Made significant progress on the mystery project, applying some newly minted object-oriented coding skills. I’ve achieved the level of awkward overconfidence.
* Two purple PCBs were completed, foiling their escape plans. Received a new shipment of 6 more boards (two designs) late last week. Will build those designs this week.
* In the studio: just one track left to overdub and master. Getting close!

- BME680 Temperature, Pressure, and Humidity sensor
- APDS-9960 Gesture Sensor
- LSM9DS1 9DoF IMU
We are still trying to figure out how to get the Microphone working in CircuitPython:
- SPH0645LM4H-B Microphone

I'm waiting for Adafruit 1.54" LCD and a j-link to arrive in Berlin so then I can start helping with bring-up as well.

@duewester (lurking)


48:50 @foamyguy
        Last Week
* Testing multiple ToF sensors on same bus
* CPX + Gizmo Thermometer screen example
* Setting up test for long term stability issue with debounce library
* Creating musical note tones with different waveforms
* Work an issue relating to temperature value from the MPU6050 breakout
        Next Week
* Finish bringing in the Compass and Inclinometer examples from an old PR
* Polish up the Gizmo thermometer example
* Work on NeoTrellis Tone Player example
* Continue debouncer test
* Playing with TPL5110 I picked up over the weekend


51:02 @geekguy - text only
* Is there a preferred tool for editing font files like font5x8.bin?
* I have been building up a script for testing many sensors where any can be turned on or off easily. This includes sensors that need to go through an I2C multiplexer. Interest?


52:10 @hierophect (out sick)
        Last week:
* Wrapped up the Meowbit board support package
* Wrote a quick demo for the Meowbit using Deshipu’s snake code
* Added UF2 boot options to the STM32 port makefile
* Added the STM32F407 Discovery, though it’s having USB issues
        This week:
* Figure out what’s wrong with the F407 Discovery USB
* Add temperature sensor and µs support to STM32 port (final 5.0 issue)
* Finish espruino ports
* Modify the STM32F4 UF2 bootloader to behave the same as Atmel/NRF on startup. 


52:58 @jepler
* Last week:
   * Worked on JEplayer bugs that I found during my own testing
   * Learned how to create release assets via actions for JEplayer
   * Investigated reported audio bugs
   * Investigated more string compression improvements
   * Reviewed the pixelbuf PR and found it nearly doubled the refresh rate of one of my LED test programs, awesome work.
   * Filed a PR to let displayio.Palette accept color tuples like pixelbuf
* This week:
   * Spending up to 2 days to help “ulab” (numpy-like module for micropython) be portable to CircuitPython, need to contact @gatherera about it
   * Once requested changes come in from Limor for JEplayer, get back on that as top priority
   * Finish up PR for looping wav files that are not multiples of buffer size
   * Investigate audio “pops” report on nRF.  Probably having never implemented  code to ramp up/down between 0% PWM and 50% PWM at the start/end of playing.
   * If so, work on implementing this
   * Can we share the “convert tuple/bytearray to color integer” code between pixelbuf and displayio palette?
* Ongoing fun projects:
   * I’ll be visiting Texas from the 12th to 24th, reduced availability on discord, will miss the weekly meeting on the 24th.  If you’re in Austin, Dallas, or parts in between and would like to have a drink together, DM me and maybe we can work something out.
