##  3:47 Community News
### The new Raspberry Pi 400 Computer released

The Raspberry Pi Foundation yesterday announced the new Raspberry Pi 400 Desktop Computer. It's all built into the keyboard! And all the ports come out the back.
This is such a great Python/CircuitPython machine (just add Blinka) plus it has all the GPIO pins for hacking.

### ulab 1.0.0 released
Version 1.0.0 of the ulab numerical library is now available. ulab provides numerical capabilities similar to the numpy library but ulab is usable on the limited resources on microcontrollers. This release implements a number of missing features, like higher-dimensional tensors, proper views of arrays, and broadcasting. In addition, a bunch of new functions have been added, as well as customisation options.
The author writes:
With the help of adafruit-sponsored people (they are credited on the front page of the PDF version of the manual), I have also updated the manual, added a reference section, and a chapter on how ulab can be extended and how new function can be implemented.
More - Library and Documentation.


### Python in Visual Studio Code Update
October 2020 Release of the Python in Visual Studio Code extension is available. You can download the Python extension from the Windows Marketplace, or install it directly from the extension gallery in Visual Studio Code. If you already have the Python extension installed, you can also get the latest update by restarting Visual Studio Code.
This was a short release where we addressed 14 issues, and it includes debugpy 1.0! Debugpy 1.0 offers a great number of features that can help you understand bugs, errors and unexpected behaviors in your code.
More - Microsoft Python Blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/python-in-visual-studio-code-october-2020-release/).

### Grayscale e-paper support added to CircuitPython
CircuitPython now supports using e-paper / eInk displays. ABove, user Joey Castillo, author of the Open Book eReader, tests out the new capability - Twitter.
And Adafruit has a new video out on the eInk refresh process - YouTube.

### Slappy.io - an easy to use web development environment for CircuitPython

slappy.io is a new, easy and fast way to write and load CircuitPython to your favorite Adafruit device, on nearly any computer. They wish to be the best solution for programming using Chromebooks and for Maker education - slappy.io and Twitter.


### A CircuitPython Sensor Ring

Hackster.io features the Sensor Ring — the latest work from Joey Castillo. Expanding on previous postings, the article discusses adding sensors and DotStar RGB LEDs, design decisions, and directions for future work - Hackster.io.
 AdaBox016 

"...when I gave CircuitPython a shot, it was amazing. Along with Mu, the simple Python text editor, I was up and running in no time. Mu recognized that I was using CircuitPython, and once I enabled serial communication to help me find the stupid syntax errors I often make, I was up and running. I hadn’t bought into the “not compiling saves time” argument of Python over C++ for microcontrollers, (especially given the lightweight programming I do) but it does turn out to be a nice feature to click save and watch my screen update."
more on this AdaBox016 build - BobTheChemist.

### Making a Heart of Te Fiti from Moana and Tony Stark Arc Reactor - Evan Weinberg and Twitter.

### Creepy Box 

Scott Young posts - Twitter
Me and Phina (4) collaborated on this to scare the wife yesterday. Adafruit HalloWing M4, some photos, bit of sound manipulation and a bit of mucking about in CircuitPython and we came up with something ‘well creepy’!

##  26:20 Status Updates
@anecdata (lurking)


@cater (lurking)


38:26 @CGrover (text only)
* Chasing some memory issues when using PyPortal, Displayio, and AIO libraries with 6.0.0rc and Requests 1.6.0. Was able to get the corrosion monitor project to work reliably by trimming out some direct displayio pixel reading and writing. Will see if I can characterize the errors to be able to submit a useful issue.
* Next project is the automated DC motor dynamometer. The perfect OSH Park PCBs arrived. Two new FeatherWings for this project, a 24-bit ADC for dual load cell measurements, and a wing that carries two INA260 breakouts for monitoring power of the test motor and the brake (dynamometer) motor.


@charlesburnaford (lurking)


39:41 @Christian Walther
* Still working on extending the supervisor memory allocator to support movable allocations that can start out on the GC heap and carry over to the next VM run, and on top of that implement set_next_code_file() and get_previous_traceback().
* Code is mostly complete, now cleaning it up, hope to have a PR for review this or next week.


40:37 @danh
* Reworked USB connection and USB serial connection detection to fix missing REPL after sleep and make `supervisor.runtime.serial_available` more accurate.
* With @jepler, got stubs uploading to Amazon S3 after a number of false starts.
* Fixed MatrixPortal pin errors.
* Did a MatrixPortal BLE demo.
* Finished remaining open PR’s and issues for 6.0.0-rc.1 release. Release notes done, will probably release today.
* Closed some very old issues.
* Starting on ESP32S2 development.


42:40 @David.Glaude (lurking)
* CP:
   * Corona App Detector:
      * First time on “Show and Tell” (Does Adafruit still have “as seen on ‘show and tell” sticker to put in my next order)?
      * Now run on ItsyBitsy nRF and Feather nRF52840 (blink a number on the blue LED)
   * Failure:
      * Attempt to build an AirLift with a “ESP32 DevKit Doit” (I have two of those doing nothing).
      * Permit different UUID on BLE UART https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_BLE/issues/37
* Non CP:
   * Upgrade my Maximite Color 2 and play BASIC version of Gauntlet and Wolfenstein 3D.
   * Watching/Reading Raspberry Pi400 video/news the whole day (I was wondering why @ladyada was wearing a Raspberry Pi shirt for “the desk of Lady Ada”.)
   * Moving from quarantine (hopefully test is negative) to second wave lockdown.


@dherrada (lurking)
             
44:03 @foamyguy
* Created a display driver for Blinka_Displayio to output to a PyGame window on RasPi and PCs. First time publishing a library on PyPi and setting up readthedocs for it!
* Fixed an issue in Group scaling on Blinka_Displayio
* Fixed a few other small issues. One in a learn guide PyRuler project, and one in the setup.py for the imageload library.
        Next week:
* Looking into Adabot library stats scripts
* Testing more displayio widgets with PyGame output


45:49 @hierophect
* Last week
   * Implemented Neopixel using the RMT peripheral on the ESP32 on the Arduino
   * Submitted a PR for SPI peripheral which I’m using for a tracking project
* This week:
   * The testers for Arduino pointed out an issue with running parallel Neopixel strips on Arduino which turned out to also be true for Circuitpython, so I’m patching that today
   * Beyond that quick fix, there’s some optimization work we can do to make Neopixel access faster
   * Working on some reviews this week from Scott, as well as checking out the UDP implementation.


@Jayguitar (lurking)


26:59 @jepler
* Last week: Worked on ESP32S2 AudioOut, but didn’t have anything to show for it
* This week: Back to CAN world, writing some guides

* Restored analogio to rfm9x and rfm69 builds
   * Recent changes in CP allowed it to fit
   * Allows monitoring of battery voltage
   * Unable to add pulseio -- okay for some languages, but not all.
* Received a metro_esp32s2 -- exploring
* Trying to work with requests on esp32s2 - having issues with espidf memory with latest library version. Not sure if the issue is CP or Request library. Only impacts https URLs
* Also trying to work on updating certificates
   * It looks to me like they are being updated as part of the build process.

@mdroberts1243 (lurking)


@microDev (text-only)
* Last week I worked on implementing RotaryIO and CountIO on the esp32s2.
* This week I plan to add more modules in the esp32s2 port which will further enhance its capabilities.


@Mr. Certainly [lurking]


34:53 @tannewt

36:10 @v923z
* Last week: 
   * finally released version 1.0.0 of ulab; already bumped version to 1.1.1 (added a new function, fixed a bug)
* This week: 
   * still working on cleaning up the code, factoring out some routines in re-usable form
   * trying to close a couple of feature requests
   * I would also like to target smaller microcontrollers, i.e., implement trade-offs, speed versus flash space. 
## 48:06 In The Weeds


48:20 @v923z 
only, if time permits, a couple of very general and short comments on integrating ulab into circuitpython without having to sacrifice the “circuitpython experience”


* Trade-offs (some implementations are still in the works); speed versus flash space
* “Scalability” and customisation; 
   * using a hierarchy of features instead of sub-modules
   * Numpy-compatibility, and “decoupling” from circuitpython
   * “Minimal” implementation; FFT for less than 5 kB




##   1:19:25 Wrap-Up
