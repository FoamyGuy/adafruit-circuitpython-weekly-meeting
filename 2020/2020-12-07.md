### Low Power Support Available on ESP32-S2
 ESP32-S2 Low Power 

Low power capability in CircuitPython has come in the form of low power modes for the ESP32-S2 chip. Other chips will be following shortly, if they are hardware capable. The details are in Pull Request #3767 merged last week into the nightly builds of CircuitPython for the ESP32-S2. While normally the recommendation would be to use CircuitPython 6.1.0-beta.2, the "Absolute Newest" on S3, an available option, is recommended for ESP32-S2 boards.
 ESP32-S2 Low Power 

Sunday, the DESK OF LADYADA went over Deep Sleep testing for ESP32-S2 and the new ESP32-S2FH4 chip! See how the new Nordic Power Profiler Kit II helps determine the power draw on sleeping boards - YouTube

 State of the Octoverse 

 State of the Octoverse 

The three 2020 State of the Octoverse reports have been released, detailing information gleaned from GitHub.
2020 has been a year of extraordinary change. Yet with 60M+ new repositories created this past year, one thing has remained true — developers came together from all corners of the world to innovate, find connection, and solve problems.
Some highlights:
* Python has grown to the #2 spot in languages used, uip from 4th in 2014.
* Typescript surged to #4, having been #10 in 2017.
* Developers have worked significantly more on Open Source projects since COVID-19 lockdowns in March, 2020.
* Open Source development jumps up during weekends.
* 35% more repositories created in 2020 than 2019
* 25% more contributions to open source projects.
See all three detailed reports - GitHub.
The CircuitPython Weekly Newsletter is a CircuitPython community-run newsletter emailed every Tuesday. The complete [archives are here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/). It highlights the latest Python on hardware related news from around the web including CircuitPython, Python and MicroPython developments.

@anecdata (lurking)


24:50 @kattni
* Last week:
   * Finished and published the MagTag Holiday LED Wreath guide
   * Modified basic Cheerlights code to display an animation on the LEDs for each color instead of simply lighting them up.
   * Started the Cheerlights LED Animations guide
   * Nearly finished Cheerlights Animations guide but Learn decided to be difficult
* Today so far:
   * Finish Cheerlights Animations guide
   * Fix code comments in ItsyBitsy BLE Infinity Cube code
   * Put Cheerlights Animations guide into moderation
* This week:
   * Update the SGP30 guide to include the STEMMA QT rev
   * New guide for SGP40 because, despite being “next gen”, they changed everything.


27:15 @Kevin Thomas - Lurking & Text Only
* Last Week
   * Presented the Study Buddy micro:bit Educational Framework at the micro:bit LIVE Global Conference - There will be a video rebroadcast of the entire event at the link below later this week.
      * https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJRGTnzeb0esPmsE-mFkPGg
   * Created the Talking TextaBot for the micro:bit V2 to help students use the buttons and logo of the device as they would use a phone keyboard to text communicate with the bot in addition to instructions on how to build out a database of trigger words and responses.
* This Week
   * Work on some foundational work for additional IoT CircuitPython tutorials to work on with FoamyGuy in the coming weeks.


28:00 @MakerMelissa
* Last Week:
   * Finished getting the WebSerial ESPTool to successfully flash an image that is <= 2MB to the ESP32-S2 boards
   * Separated FakeRequests into its own Repo
   * Added DeepSleep and LightSleep functions to MagTag library.
   * Improved MagTag memory usage and speed by implementing Font Caching.
   * Wrote PortalBase, which is a base library for Portal-style libraries and used some of the latest stuff from the MagTag library.
   * Refactored the MagTag library to use PortalBase
   * Updated MagTag guide to reflect the additional MagTag dependencies
* This Week:
   * Work on the WebSerial ESPTool to add stub loading functionality so we can flash images > 2MB and do a full chip erase.
   * Possibly refactor some more libraries to use PortalBase
   * If there’s time, test out Blinka on MicroPython in its current state with the PyBoard


29:37 @microDev (text-only)
* Last Week
   * Got OTA (over-the-air) update working.
      * https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/3777
* This Week
   * Get back to i2cperipheral.
   * Start work on ULP and touch alarms.
   * More OTA work… will probably make a PR soon.


@Mr. Certainly [lurking]


30:02 @tannewt
* Picked up sleep from Dan. Should make a PR later today (Monday)
* Also fixing some safe mode issues where it would reset but run the bad code again.
* Will be bug hunting after that.




31:11 @Christian Walther (lurking)
* Working on the feature PRs enabled by the new supervisor allocator, set_next_code_file() and get_previous_traceback(): Making them optional so they can be disabled on boards with too little flash, and examining their interactions with deep sleep.


31:31 @danh
* Deep sleep PR merged.
* Released 6.1.0-beta.2, which includes deep sleep and a bunch of ESP32-S2 fixes and improvements.
* Fixed MagTag library voltage monitor calculation.
* Did a lot of measuring and instrumentation trying to track down remaining voltage monitor inaccuracy. Mysterious 150mV offset disappeared under closer examination.
* To do:
   * Finish short deep-sleep guide. 
   * work adding backup RAM and/or registers module, to allow saving state during a deep sleep. May call it “sleep RAM”.


33:35 @David.Glaude (lurking)
* Testing Seeeduino CP capable board: XIAO and Wio Terminal
* PiHole:
   * Made a DHCP mess of my network => power cycling all of my IoT device.

   * Found a way to make BMP file with mspaint that crash OnDiskBitmap: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_MagTag/issues/34


34:07 @foamyguy
* Last week:
   * Completed work on the --commit-hash arg for the blinka-cli tool
   * Dig into the deep sleep API and convert the MagTag Progress Display scripts to use it
   * Tinkering with the LC709203 Fuel gauge breakout. Considering using it in a MagTag fridge widget project
   * Gained a new kitty over the weekend!
* Next week
   * Working on MagTag weather and other pertinent data widget that will go on the fridge. Will use a sensor to show indoor temp and humidity. And use openweather API to show outdoor weather for my area. Possibly a few other pieces of info. Will also use my display_layouts library for the interface.
   * Keep working on basic “scheduling” system for MatrixPortal.
   * Try out the display_text and bitmap_font PRs


36:33 @hierophect

   * TCP Server


@Jayguitar (lurking)


37:49 @jepler
* Last week:
   * Worked on I2C on esp32s2 with no success
   * Recently published guide “pedal for youtube” (ble on raspberry pi with blinka)
* This week:
   * Working on speeding up font loading for magtag (hopefully!)
      * Optimizing the loading of the plain text font file format, got 40% speed improvement
      * Implementing a binary font format (benchmarking TODO)
   * Two (and a half?) other project guides in the works


39:49 @jerryn (lurking)
* Nothing to report :-(


## 40:13 In The Weeds  


40:38 @hierophect: Is it possible to free up space in the ESP32S2 flash? Enabling unicode with Joey’s Babel module would require 2MB of space. Could this be achieved by reducing the size of the filesystem, or potentially the size of the Circuitpython build itself?
## 48:58 Wrap-Up
