## 10:00 State of CircuitPython, Libraries and Blinka
### 10:48 Overall
* 19 pull requests merged
  * 16 authors - makermelissa, kattni, Flameeyes, weblate, jerryneedell, tinue, jepler, DustinWatts, hhk7734, PTS93, vooralfred, dronecz, caternuson, dunkmann00, brentru, rhooper

Overall: on the core side 5.3 is stable, 5.4 is in beta, and we’ll need a little bit more work before we can stabilize it.  Things have been about as Scott expected, but we need to work on performance.
Blinka continues to gain support for new boards, credit to MakerMelissa.  The libraries are starting to ramp up again as Adafruit releases new products, but in the meantime it was good to see the libraries be maintained.  “It’s like doing all the weeding tasks of getting our ducks in a row”.

@charlesburnaford (lurking)


37:53 @danh
* Implementing the _bleio scanning API using bleak. Spent time learning the details of using asyncio with threads. The janus.queue library was very helpful. Having issues with MacOS, but it works on Linux and Windows.
* Will continue implementing more of _bleio with bleak this week.


@davep (lurking)


41:14 @DavidGlaude (lurking):
* USB Host Co-Processor (over UART):
   * Wrote a Pull Request to fix usb-hid keyboard circuitpython code in USB Host Co-Processor by gdsports
   * Made a bluetooth version and then a version that duplicate USB keyboard to simultaneously USB and BLE: https://twitter.com/DavidGlaude/status/1264245116664938497
   * Made my first FeatherWing, a "UART Trinket M0 CoPro" for the same project: https://twitter.com/DavidGlaude/status/1264590297654272002


41:52 @foamyguy
* This week
   * Finished Tilemap Game Guide and made the PR with example code.
   * Tested text and shapes with displayio for Blinka
   * LED Animation testing
   * Testing the fixes for font and anchored position in the display_text library
   * Started looking into BLE services with Circuit Python for the Android Bluefruit Playground app. Will need some more work to get it working.
* Next Week
   * Solder and test color sensor
   * Work on the Bluefruit Playground app
* Outside Circuit Python:
   * Temperature scanning hand sanitizer kiosk
   * Terraria!! 


43:47 @geekguy (Text Only)
* This week:
   * Continuing work on Blinka to add the UDOO Bolt boards.
   * More work on the HT16K33 library.
      * Bring the 7-Segment display routines up to par with the alphanumeric routines.
      * Add animation support for the 7-Segment displays.
* Next week:
   * More work on the HT16K33 library.
      * Start work to add multiple display support for the segment displays.
      * Port all changes to the Micropython version of this library, which I now maintain.
   * Find another library to mangle.


44:30 @hierophect (unable to make today’s meeting)
* Last week:
   * One directional UART for the i.MX
   * A big combo PR that cleans up everything across the i.MX Busio and digitalio systems - solves a number of bugs and most of the “test this” issues. 
   * Lots of reading about i.MX and kvetching about their API
* This week:
   * Finally getting around to the RGBMatrix on the H7
   * Either PulseIn/PulseOut or fixing STM32 bugs, depending on what Arturo is up to
   * STM32 Timer Allocator
45:10 @jasonp
* Finish a few CircuitPython examples for Evo M51
* VSCode “helper” script to auto-copy CircuitPython source file to code.py on device - currently doing this manually
   * Either write something 
   * Or discover something that already exists


47:00 @jepler
* Last week:
   * Starting on support for Feather STM32F405’s SD slot, which requires SDIO
   * Making builds fit again with the completed German translation
      * Dusted off a dictionary-compression scheme for messages.  This doesn’t help with the German “single-byte” translation.  It does help with the double byte translations, probably because the code size impact is not as big
   * I think this was last week?  My MP3 Player guide is finished and live on the learn system.
   * Pushing the limits, I found that on the Trellis M4 it’s possible to mix 4 monophonic MP3 streams playing from internal flash
   * Reproduced a reported bug that “voice 0” and “voice 1” sound different in audiomixer, but only when “voice0” is not playing something
   * “Fixed” a problem with the Github Actions cache of the esp32 toolchain, though I don’t know that the fix is absolutely right.  I’d encourage @tannewt to check up on it and revise or revert as necessary.
* This week:
   * Finish up SD-card-only SDIO support on the STM32F405 Feather
   * Add it to the existing PR for SPI sdcard in core
   * Depending on reactions in reviews, I’d like to release this as _sdcardio even though there won’t be a SDIO “bus object”, just a fixed SDIO bus.
   * Whatever else comes up


52:13 @jerryn
* Last week
   * Slowly working on updates to RFM9x/69 guide pages.
   * Exploring esp32s2
      * Finding some issues -- is it too early for opening issues?
   * Migrated robot to new tracked chassis. 
* Next week
   * Continue RFM9x/69 guide updates
   * Continue esp32s2 exploration
   * Expecting some excitement in the birdhouse - eggs should hatch


54:03 @kattni
* Last week:
   * Put the LED Animation guide into moderation.
   * Continued bug-fixing and added more examples to the LED Animation library
   * Started work on a virtual workshop for Microsoft - was originally going to be a live workshop at PyCon, converted it to virtual and more relevant content.
* This week:
   * Today is newsletter video day - which means nothing else.
   * Porting the AHTx0 library from Arduino to CircuitPython for the AHT10 sensor.
   * Write the product guide for the AHT10.
   * Record Microsoft workshop.


58:30 @makermelissa
* Last Week:
   * Focussed mostly on writing displayio library for Blinka
   * Helped out @geekguy with working on adding UDOO Bolt to Blinka
* This Week:
   * Working on a Calendar Demo using Python
   * Add Odroid XU4 to circuitpython.org


59:07 @markolsson (Text Only)
* Last week
   * Finished designing my first CircuitPython compatible boards and a baseboard for Saola, gone to JLCPCB. Will push to github.
   * Got VCP code finally sorted and PR has been merged.
   * Commited new board support for TinyUSB
   * Fixed serial UTF-8 issue in Mu editor.
* This week
   * Will get back to the DAPIO (formally SWDIO) issue.
   * If that’s finished, then I’ll look into some build optimisations (Docker)

@Mr Certainly (lurking)


59:53 @sommersoft
* Last Week:
   * RosiePi:
      * Got most of the physaCI job results website done. It's deploying and serving at least. I need to tweak the frontend design a little, as well as the backend service since it takes a while to respond.
      * RPi 4 came in. Initial tests weren't great, but an improvement. Soft-reset-into-bootloader still fails, but now I at least get the kernel oops and the whole system doesn't lock up. Though USB is completely smashed, forcing a restart.
   * Very slightly related: I finally selected and bought a new office chair. It's not the $1000+ Steelcase Gesture I wanted, but after 12 years pretty much anything is a good replacement for the current chair.
* This Week:
   * - RosiePi:
      * Last few tweaks to website/backend, buy domain, make public.
      * Dive into USB issues again, but with new info. Hoping its just udev-solvable, since the RPi 3 responded to that somewhat.
   * Teensy 4.0 came in with the RPi 4 order, so I'd like to get that port up and running locally and maybe hit some of the easier TODOs/issues. I have the strange urge to stretch my C-legs.


1:02:55 @stargirl (offline)
* Packing and shipping Winterbloom’s first 70 orders.
* Got Hostess firmware running on the new hardware and got the current-limit switch working. More progress on this once I get all of my orders shipped.
