## 16:40 Hug Reports
[@jepler:] Every week, we take the time to thank others for the good stuff they are doing.  Whether it's someone who helped you out directly, or someone doing good in the community, that's up to you.  We call this section "Hug Reports"


As Kattni mentioned earlier, Hug Reports are done in a round robin.  I'll start, then follow the list alphabetically, jumping back to the top of the alphabet until everyone has a turn.  If you can't attend or are text only, then I will read your notes from the document when your name comes up.  If I miss someone by accident, please speak up or drop a text note on the channel.

## 31:00 Status Updates
[@jepler] Next is Status updates.  Status updates are run in the same round robin fashion as Hug Reports.  Take a couple of minutes to let us know what you did last week, and what you are planning to do this week.  If it's a longer topic that you want to open for discussion, please hold it until the final section, In The Weeds.  And if you have a discussion topic but haven't put it in the notes doc yet, please do that now.






31:20 @jepler
* Last week:
   * JEplayer switched to portrait mode
   * PyPortal port started
   * PR’d “ulab”, a vector/matrix library in C.
   * Tried to add ramp up/down to nRF PWM out, but it didn’t work out
* This week:
   * today/tue: JEplayer
   * Wed: travel
   * thu/fri: back to working on ulab PR, reduced hours
* In the Austin area from 13th to 19th, Dallas area from 21st to 23rd.  Travel tips or want to meet?  DM me!


33:12 @kattni
* Last week:
   * Finished the CLUE library - released and into the world, and immediately received bug reports, like you do.
   * Fixed bugs.
   * Finished CLUE product guide 
   * Started creating a series of CLUE demos, some based on Sensor Lab from Arduino:
      * Height Calculator
      * Spirit Level
      * Temperature and Humidity Monitor
   * Began guide pages for each of the new CLUE demos in the CLUE guide - will include intro, code, image and simple explanation of code.
   * Bundle/release issues.
* This week:
   * Library Monday!
   * Blog posts for recently released guides: MLX90640, DPS310, CLUE
   * Document running CP Weekly meeting
   * Get images/vid for CLUE demos
   * Compass demo


@KingerNorth (lurking)


38:20 @MakerMelissa
* Last Week:
   * Heads down with adding functionality to the Web Plotter to make it work with Sensor Lab
   * Updated Raspberry Pi installer Scripts for Kernel Level TFT drivers to fix bugs and work better such as adding rotation on the 240x240 when using the console.
* This Week:
   * More Web Plotter/Sensor Lab integration
   * Hoping to work on some of my pending PRs


@Mr. Certainly (lurking)


@mscosti (lurking)


39:05 @siddacious
* Wrote and released guides for the LIS3MDL and LSMDS33
* Wrote most of the guides for the ICM20649 and LIS2MDL. Both are waiting for PCBs and for it to get into production for the final pictures
*  Working on the Sip and puff code, got it in a good state, wrapping up the software today and then starting the project guide. It’s been fun writing user space code and flexing parts of my brain that have been lazing about while I write libraries. It’s also been cool to work on something that will with any luck be a help to folks that need it. I look forward to working more on assistive tech projects




@sommersoft (in another meeting):
* 

41:38 @tannewt
* Spoke at PyCascades over the weekend. Standalone video should be released officially in the next few days.
* Got 4ish PRs/pushes out around BLE sensor net stuff. Hope to wrap it up this week but will also spend some time seeing if I can get a raspberry pi going as a broadcastnet bridge.
* Will be catching up today on email and reviews.
* I’m also sitting in on some Zephyr RTOS meetings including the Technical Steering Committee. Interesting insight into the community there.




48:20 @TG-Techie:
* This past week has been working on a website because current projects only documented in head and update letters to grandfather, but no resume or portfolio. Using jekyll and css from scratch.
* Waiting on Circuit boards for watch, which just came in.
* GUI work stalled
* A bunch of soldering with a 3-day weekend.


@Andrew Tribble (lurking)


@AnneB (lurking)


@cater (lurking)


@CGrover (lurking)


50:41 @danh
* Built and released 5.0.0-beta.5 last Tuesday.
* Improved accuracy of `time.monotonic_ns()` and `time.sleep()` to microseconds instead of milliseconds.
* Fixed a bug in nrf I2C speed setting.
* Spent a lot of time figuring out why I2C transactions were taking progressively longer in a simple example. It turned out to have nothing to do with I2C, but is due to storage allocation associated with a `with` statement.
* Added tuple and list support to `Palette.color()` on request of @kattni.
* WIll be working on:
   * Continued fixing of remaining issues for 5.0.0 release
   * nrf SPIM3 (high speed SPI)


@DaveP (lurking)

## 1:03:11 In the Weeds


@dglaude Should there be a mini library bundle for CLUE, PyBadge, ...?
The rationale is that for boards with a lot of sensors, or libraries that have a lot of dependencies, having a single zip file that brings all in one everything you need to control your hardware (including neopixel if any) would speed up things.
Right now I seemd to again and again copy the same file over and over each time there is a library update. And some library are a single *.mpy while others are a folder, so doubling the search time.
* Ideally - in bundle repo, build mini board-specific bundles, link from cp.org/board pages.


1:15:13 @siddacious Going to be working on CP code to interact with droids from the Droid Depot in Galaxy’s Edge in DisneyLand/World. Let me know if you’d like to help, either on the code or testing
