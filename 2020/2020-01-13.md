*  Working on libraries for the new 9-dof sensor for circuitpython and refactoring the arduino library
*  A bit more work on the Arduino actions migration
*  Testing the ICM 20649 rev b
*  Continuing my attempts to tame my 3D printer
* Hopefully brainstorming with like-minded folks about CP2020 related ideas. @ me in #circuitpython if you’d like to jam


51:08 @MakerMelissa
* Last Week:
   * Finished writing the guide for the Animated Gif Player
   * Lots of Blinka work
      * I got the Sifive PR ready, but it is untested due to being a rare board
      * I tested an outstanding PR from @sommersoft for PlatformDetect on RPi Ubuntu
      * We have Blinka fully working and tested on the Pine A64 board
   * Lots of reviewing and testing:
      * Tested a PR for the Arduino SSD1306 library
      * Reviewed CircuitPython GFX PR
      * Reviewed a new CircuitPython RGB Display PR
   * Added more boards to Downloads and Blinka in circuitpython.org
* This week:
   * Resume working on the HT16K33 Driver and Guide updates
   * Start on a Pine 64 Blinka Guide
   * Likely review additional Blinka PRs


52:40 @sommersoft (text only)
* Last Week:
   * Adabot:
      * Made a change to the common function that grabs library repos so that it now ignores archived repos.
      * Created, tested, and PR'd a patchfile to amend the pylint command for examples in each library’s build.yml. Will likely run it tonight; though I want to allow someone else the opportunity to gain the experience of working with the patches capability.
   * RosiePi:
      * Made some decisions on my security considerations. Started setting up things to test those out, to include user setup, authentication & authorization scheme, and how to safely queue jobs that require escalation of privileges (sudo).
* This Week:
   * RosiePi/physaCI:
      * I really need to clean up the GitHub presence. I've started looking at moving them to a new account/org. Will likely pursue that more this week.
      * Keep moving forward on the node integration with physaCI.


53:46 @stargirl (text only)
* Deep in the PCB layout rabbit hole for Winterbloom Sol.


54:00 @tannewt
* Fully swept up into iMX RT vortex. Reworking linker scripts to make varying flash sizes easier to work with. Will have PR with Teensy 4 support along with other EVK boards.
* Did #CircuitPython2020 post: https://blog.adafruit.com/2020/01/10/tannewts-focus-for-circuitpython2020/
* Have been posting community ones to the blog as well.
* “Launched” CircuitPython on Teensy: https://forum.pjrc.com/threads/59040-CircuitPython-on-Teensy-4!
* Spent weekend on Tiny Logic Friend. Goal is to enable low speed logic analysis with the SAMD51 on all existing boards, not just something new. Fixed a PulseView Mac bug that was driving a spike into my head.
* Still need to sort out BLE lib deps for the sphinx builds. It is blocking AMS library release. It’d be helpful if someone could get the BLE library on pypi and a stub for _bleio into Blinka.
* JP is doing BLE HID this week which should be good to go.




58:25 @brentru
* LW:
   * 2 factor authenticator for PyPortal - guide out by Wed.
   * Progressbar library
   * Doxygen’ing Adafruit IO Arduino (older library, lots of files, good to look at for some inspiration with Adafruit IO CircuitPython)
   * Buncha internal Adafruit tasks
* TW:
   * Will be AFK from tomorrow til next week, moving and setting up a new office!
      * I’ll be in the notes and listening on Spotify, I have a lecture this semester during the CP Weekly
         * I’ve enjoyed being a part of the meeting this past Fall 


@cater (lurking for status)


59:49 @CGrover (text only, in a noisy environment)
* Yesterday and before:
   * Wrapped up most of the in-studio recording work, so was able to make progress on the trying-to-keep-it-a-secret project (restoring a lost family heirloom using CircuitPython). Since the project involves noisy physical and electronic audio components, hiding it while working on it has been a challenge. 
   * The secret project tossed me into a mixing bowl of data/unit conversion and physical constants (see the resulting in-progress CedarGrove Converters). Had fun with the Ohm’s Law calculator and musical note/frequency/notation converter. Was profoundly humbled by the automatic Daylight Saving Time converter, but have a working version now.
   * Worked on transforming the Thermal Camera documentation to be more guide-like.
* Tomorrow and beyond:
   * The remainder of this week will be focused on the secret project and Thermal Camera documentation.
   * Those lovely purple un-populated PCBs are still staring at me. Is there a YouTube channel for entertaining bored PCBs?


1:00:57 @danh
* BLE Bonding works! PR really soon.
* I’m behind on PR reviews and some bug fixes and will get back to that this week.


1:02:13 @Dave Briccetti (away)
* Have made Circuit Playground Express and Raspberry Pi versions of a smart thermostat. https://github.com/dcbriccetti/smart-thermostat. I actually trust it to operate when I leave the house for several hours now. :-)
* Will soon modify advanced CircuitPython Circuit Playground Express examples for Bluefruit.


1:02:54 @davidglaude (likely sleeping)
* Getting ready for Fosdem’20 presentation
   * Got Blinka stickers from @phil (THANKS again)
   * Preparing Slides
   * Going across all the the blogpost of CP release: https://gist.github.com/dglaude/9de9e73d490eb45fb7180b930e00a872
   * Creating a Adafruit Jargon dictionary: https://gist.github.com/dglaude/bc8043cdccef9e643eeaeb99f2e9fb97
   * Waiting for my PyPortal to maybe demo that rather than PyGamer+Airlift
   * Testing nrf52840-LED-hat code, maybe for a surprise demo
* Perfecting my PyGamer+MLX90640 example to use map_range (self inflicted issue+PR)
* Checking BLE MicroPython on ESP32 to see if it can talk to CircuitPython BLE


@devoh (lurking)


1:03:54@Drew Fustini
* Still working through some issues with PWMOut on beaglebone and pocket beagle




1:04:25 @foamyguy - Text only, still no microphone :(
* Bluefruit Playground App, Past Week: 
   * Updated the image assets to fit nicer on a wider range of screen sizes
   * Fixed a few of the remaining minor differences between the iOS app and the Android one
   * Got touch dragging to change the camera view in the Accelerometer Module working.
* Next Week
   * Switch neopixel animations to use “fast as it can” approach instead of hardcoded frame durations
   * Make the app exit the background service a bit more aggressively when it is not in use. 
   * Testing around disconnecting/reconnecting to different Android devices to ensure everything is working smoothly. 


1:05:09 @hierophect
* This past week I worked primarily on cleanup work and issue resolution for 5.0. Dealt with:
   * CPython compatibility, 
   * Simplex SPI
   * Cleanups to the entirety of DisplayIO for formatting and consistency
   * Fixed a PWM issue related to optimization
   * Continuing work on the Meowbit
   * Some preliminary work on the Espruinos and Discovery F405. 
   * Circuitpython 2020 writing, which was fun to talk and think about. 
* This week I’m hoping to resolve some interrupt related issues with the Meowbit, and I’ll be taking a look at why flash and DisplayIO aren’t playing well with each other on that board. I’d also like to start work on some of the new boards I’m adding to the port. A less pleasant task will be getting all my toolchains up and running on my new computer, since I’m really starting to feel the 4G of flash memory on my current machine. 


1:08:08 @hukuzatuna (Phil M)
* Progress on Sphero control library. Detects all BLE robots (SPRK+ and later).
* Working on solving “user selection of robots” problem in a generic way. I.e., if there are four robots turned on, how does the user select one given CPB or other Bluefruit devices?
* Next: write command library.


@jasonp (lurking) 


1:08:42 @jepler
* Last week:
   * AudioMixer testing (conclusion: works OK for WaveFIles, just not quite fast enough for MP3 playback from SD).  Investigated some performance improvements, but still may not quite make it fast enough
   * Also looking into problems with RawSample + AudioMixer where I’m still confused
   * Fixed hard faults on os.urandom, allow >64 bytes os.urandom on nRF
   * Some PR reviews
   * Found a problem where on SAMD AudioOut, the left and right channels of an mp3 are badly desynced (by one mp3 frame, I think) -- it’s specific to MP3s
* This week:
   * Address mp3 desync problem
   * PR AudioMixer performance improvements if they seem solid
   * Investigate switching AudioMixer to saturating arithmetic
   * Hopefully get back to JEplayer feature development
   * Hopefully more PR reviews
* Ongoing fun projects:
   * Building custom raspberry pi images with pi-gen
   * Should get access to a formlabs printer at the bigger local maker space this week


1:10:36 @jerryn
* Last week
   * Still struggling with making “reliable datagram mode”  for RFM9x/69 reliable…
   * Also trying to improve the use of interrupts on Raspberry Pi for RFM9x/69
   * Got some valuable experience testing Bluefruit Android App. Learned a bunch of new tricks!
* Next week
   * Continue RFM9x/69 work.
   * Whatever else I feel like working on .. I’m getting used to being retired ;-)
