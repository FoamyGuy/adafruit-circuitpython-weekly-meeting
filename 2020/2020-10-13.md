## 1:25 Community News
### 1:25 Visual Studio Code now supports Raspberry Pi and ARM Chromebooks
Microsoft Visual Studio Code (VSC) is one of the most popular pieces of programming software on the planet, in part because it's available on any plaform a developer might want to use it on. At least, mostly. One missing piece was ARM support for Linux devices, but with the latest update, 1.50, that's been rectified.
This news has two huge applications in Making and education. The first is the Raspberry Pi, running an ARM CPU and Linux and now Visual Studio Code. The Raspberry Pi 4 is a potent machine, with up to 8GB of RAM, but Visual Studio Code also makes it extremely easy to leverage remote machines for more intensive workloads.
The other big application is ARM Chromebooks. It's been possible to install Visual Studio Code on Chromebooks with Linux support for some time, but ARM-powered devices have been lacking. Now it's officially a thing: downloading the ARM installer from the Visual Studio Code downloads page - Windows Central, Twitter and Download.
### 2:00 QT Py CircuitPython Tricks
QT Py Tricks is a collection of projects for using the Adafruit QT Py mini-board running CircuitPython 6. The code will also work on a Trinket M0 and othert CircuitPython-compatible boards with an adjustment to board pin assignments. Github
### 2:20 Today is Ada Lovelace Day
The world celebrates Ada Lovelace Day on the 2nd Tuesday of October (today!).
Instead of lamenting all the in person gatherings and halloween hoedowns that aren’t happening this year; get into all the virtual activities coming your way!
Today Adafruit is spending the day highlighting a number of women who are pioneers of their fields and inspiring women of all ages to make their voices heard.
Finding Ada has some ways you can get involved and spread the word:
* Send a Tweet
* Update Facebook
* Add a link to FindingAda.com on LinkedIn
* Write about Ada Lovelace Day on your blog
* Email your friends and/or relevant mailing lists
* Post an item on LinkedIn or Facebook Groups
You can read more, find events, and get involved!

## 20:49 Status Updates

22:12 @jepler
* Last week: 
   * Reviewed and approved PRs (after gentle reminder from Tannewt to do it) including translations
   * Worked on improving the build parallelization (some merged, some not yet merged)
   * Updated protomatter
   * Worked on Arduino CAN support, making sure it interoperates with CircuitPython
* This week:
   * Wrapping up Arduino CAN, hopefully
   * Returning to a learn guide about a calculator project I did
   * Soon, doing CAN on esp32s2


22:38 @jerryn
* Is the issue with SSL Certificates on the ESP32S2  something that can be tackled by a mere mortal? https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/3424  I’ll be happy to try, but it is not obvious to me where it needs to be done.
   * Is this blocking any release?


24:51 @kattni
* Last week, yesterday and earlier today:
   * Can’t remember where I left off last week so some of this may be duplicated.
   * Added CircuitPython page to the SH1107 guide
   * Fritzed up the Metro ESP32-S2
   * Solder up QT Py Haxpress
   * Tested LED Animation library on QT Py Haxpress
   * Started a QT Py and NeoPixels guide for both base QT Py and QT Py Haxpress
   * Added FAQ to CircuitPython LED Animations guide
   * Added Mark(Gamblor) to CircuitPythonLibrarians
* This week:
   * Finish QT Py and NeoPixels guide - needs images/vid/GIFs
   * Think of a few (possibly simple) QT Py projects to do
   * Possibly write up a one-page guide on VS Code for Raspberry Pi/Chromebook
   * Various fritzing objects need to be created


@Kevin Thomas - mytechnotalent - [Lurking…]


27:22 @makermelissa (Missing Meeting)
* Last Week:
   * Finished writing the BrainCraft HAT guide
   * Updated the Machine Learning my Raspberry Pi TensorFlow guide with the latest updates
   * Updated the PiTFT Easy Install page with the latest information including running my Python Script rewrite
   * Worked on improving/optimizing a Scoreboard Demo for JP’s workshop
   * Did a sweep of the existing PyPortal issues
   * Dug into some of the incompatible changes with Requests and PyPortal, but didn’t get very far
   * Started working on a new BrainCraft Google Assistant guide
* This Week:
   * Finish up BrainCraft Google Assistant guide
   * Test out some more obscure MatrixPortal library configurations
   * Test out an issue with the SSD1351 on Arduino
* Other Stuff:
   * Worked on hacking a keyboard to implement MIDI. I got as far as successfully detecting all key presses and releases. Ended up going the Arduino route due to 5-Volt logic used in the keyboard and not wanting to complicate things with logic level shifters.


@Mark(Gamblor) [lurking]


@Mr. Certainly [lurking]


@stu (lurking until in the weeds)


28:38 @tannewt
* Finished up the iMX RT work and submitted it. The flash config is now unified and sets quad enable on start up.
* Knocked out 6.0.0 issues.
   * Fixed STM I2C timeout issue due to clock going backwards. Reading 3 registers needs sync.
   * Fixed SAMD21 auto-reload broken due to sleep overriding the tick timeout.
   * Fixed SAMD21 timing problems that led to _pew flickering.
* Going to do a release candidate this week. Any issues that should block it?
* Next up is the deep sleep API (for real this time). I’m thinking it’ll be `sleepio` and alarm modules.

31:45 @CGrover (text only)
* Learning, learning, learning. The LORA/Arduino-based Workshop Corrosion Monitor is now nearly all CircuitPython and AIO. Proof of concept was proved so now it’s time to order those expensive indoor and outdoor sensors. Still need to noodle a more reliable algorithm for predicting future corrosion potential. 
* In the design phase for two new EUROrack modules. Front panels, physical UI, and most CPy code modules are good-to-go. Just need to work out some pesky hardware issues. Predominantly, how much stuff can be jammed into a 10HP module?
* Also designing a DC motor characterization workbench to study low-speed torque control for a couple of robot projects. Will be testing a dynamometer scheme as soon as strain gauges and the companion Wheatstone bridge arrive. Will take a shot at converting the 24-bit I2C Wheatstone ADC’s Arduino library code to CPy. Oh, and will need to pick up some additional 2020 extrusion hardware to mount the torque converter and test motor. Love working with those adult Erector Set components!


@charlesburnaford (lurking)


33:00 @danh
* Starting to work again, split keyboard helping (Kinesis Freestyle Edge). Things are working out well.
* Working on Blinka _bleio on Raspberry Pi: it strangely works on some boards (Pi0w and Pi3B) and not others (Pi3B+ and Pi4B). I’m working on a guide for Blinka _bleio, but need to resolve the RPi idiosyncrasies.


@dave P (lurking)


@David.Glaude (lurking)
* Soldering:
   * QT-Py Haxpress (someone should put extra warning to say that QT-Py is small and the thing you solder is even smaller).
   * Matrix Portal M4 for 64x64 (I may have destroyed the pad by trying to use soldering wicked to reduce the blob size… test and repair in progress)
* Improving my Corona App detector on CPB (I should be ready for my would be first Show&Tell or a learn guide): https://github.com/dglaude/CircuitPython_ContactScanner/blob/main/cpb_corona.py
* QT-Py trick of the week (based on @todbot idea): a Keyboard prank that remove CAPS LOCK and other when you press it: https://github.com/dglaude/my_qtpy_trick/blob/main/prank_lock.py


@deshipu (lurking)


@dherrada (lurking)


35:04 @foamyguy
* Last week:
   * Multi-tasking guide published
   * Testing for a few PRs on PyPortal library and Protomatter update in core
   * Made a bit of progress on the Mobile Phone app for my BLE “Smart” Charger. Was able to successfully “see” statuses from the Itsy Bitsy nrf.
* Next week
   * Explore possibility of using SAMD21 as a Keyboard pass-through device to work around a weird driver quirk
   * Get Monster M4sk set up and perhaps a few other halloween decorations.


## 36:41 In The Weeds
* 37:05 @tannewt: Micro:bit v2
* 38:40 @tannewt: Any concerns about a release candidate?
* 46:40 @kattni: Have we been keeping up with Hacktoberfest? Author lets us know, and we add the label.
* 49:45 @stu: iot blockchain
* 54:23 @david.glaude (simple question since I am text-only): Is it possible to talk to the SPI chip soldered on QT-Py while using the non Haxpress firmware? Maybe as a storage for data logging?


## 59:10 Wrap-Up
