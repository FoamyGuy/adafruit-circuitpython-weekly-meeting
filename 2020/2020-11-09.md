We are seeing consistent numbers of PRs, and from zero to 3 new libraries a week.  It’s excellent to see things expanding and growing.  This makes it much easier for people to use CircuitPython in their project.  Contributing to the libraries are a great way to help make that happen.

28:02 @dherrada (lurking)
* Last week
   * Working on a few guides
* This week
   * Hopefully finishing the guides I was working on
   * Testing some PRs


28:15 @foamyguy
* Last week
   * Made a “Pixel Art Painting” demo with a Matrix Portal controlled by BLE Connect Smartphone app.
   * Learned how to set up Adabot to run it’s reports locally. Added more Blinka repos to that section of the reports. Add docs links to generated libs md file 
   * Update Feather Sense guide screenshot and library list for the newest version of lsm6ds library.
   * First time going on show and tell!
   * Learn how to build circuitpython.org locally
   * Test bus_device in core branch
   * Created SlideShow library example showing use of alignment features
   * Troubleshoot and try to fix an issue unhiding Groups and TileGrids in the core
* This Week
   * Looking into refactoring SlideShow library to play nicely with other things on the display
   * Looking into refactoring Blinka_PyPortal to optionally not import secrets directly due to naming conflict with CPython module.
   * Work on cycling through lines of text when there is more than can fit on a small screen


33:11 @hierophect

* This week: Back to esp32s2 audioout
* Fun stuff: New 3D printer!  I bought into all the marketing and got an Original Prusa.  More build area than my previous printer, better build surface & auto bed leveling were the main points


36:36 @jerryn
* Nothing significant to report.
* I have been dragged “kicking and screaming” out of retirement temporarily. Hopefully not for too long and only half-time but it cuts into play-time...




37:11 @kattni
* Last week:
   * Published Metro ESP32-S2 guide
   * Tested install instructions in Metro guide and found quirks/issues so Limor could update instructions to be better.
   * Wrote up a page explaining the pin naming in CircuitPython including a fancy pin diagram.
   * Created 6 fritzing objects.
   * Added to the Downloads page in the BMP3xx guide to include BMP390.
   * Found a bug in the back silk on the 128x64 OLED FeatherWing (button labels on pins are backwards, e.g. ABC, should be CBA)
   * Add BMP390 STEMMA QT fritzing diagrams to BMP3xx guide
* This week:
   * MAGTAG guide.
   * New guide on how to pick which CircuitPython board is right for you.


42:05 @Kevin Thomas - Lurking, Text-Only
* Last week:
   * Created a new micro:bit V2 tutorial on how to modify a C library
      * Taught how to add a library function called microbit.temperature_f() to which when called in the Python REPL would read the board’s internal temperature sensor and convert it to Farenheight and return that value to the user
   * Partnered with @FoamyGuy to create a CircuitPython IoT Streaming Data ESP32-S2 OLED Version tutorial in addition to a REPL version for the Metro ESP32-S2
* This week:
   * Developing a more in-depth tutorial for how to create a custom C library for the new micro:bit V2 in preparation for their launch
      * Develop a custom music theory C library that will be callable in the Python REPL to where the user can pass in a note such as 'c' and it will return all of the chords in the c major scale.  
      * There will be a minor key conversion function as well for all of the notes from a to g including all of the relative sharps and flats.


43:11 @MakerMelissa
* Last Week:
   * Added 8 new Blinka boards to circuitpython.org
   * Worked with @tannewt to get some Requests/Esp32SPI bugs squashed
   * Updated PyPortal library to handle HTTP errors better
   * Ported PyPortal library improvements to MatrixPortal library
   * Added 2.9” Tri-Color FeatherWing to eInk breakouts and FeatherWings guide
* This Week:
   * Working on writing a MagTag library


44:04 @Mark(Gamblor) [lurking/text only]

44:16 @microDev (text-only)
   * Finished the RotaryIO and CountIO implementation for the esp32-s2.
   * This week I’m working on implementing camera module for esp32-s2. 
   * Also I plan to upgrade the current camera module implementation to a more mature camio api.


@Mr. Certainly [lurking]


25:46 @tannewt
   * Merged ESP32SPI and Requests fixes. Will hopefully work better for everyone.
   * This week I’m working on a MagTag project for myself and running down issues as I find them. Will likely fix -S2 connecting to Adafruit IO.

## 44:47 In The Weeds
45:21 @foamyguy, @carter
Displayio based examples for RGB Matrices and other external displays. Many new users are getting introduced to CircuitPython and displayio using Matrix Portal and RGB Matrix devices now. Much of the existing example code uses board.DISPLAY which won’t work on that device.
Proposal is to create a guide page that details how to set up various different external displays and matrices. Then in the example code consistently use something like this:

```
# use built in display (PyPortal, PyGamer, PyBadge, CLUE, etc.)
# see guide for setting up external displays (TFT / OLED breakouts, RGB matrices, etc.)
display = board.DISPLAY
```

Linking to the guide page mentioned above. Encouraging people to use a display variable like this instead of board.DISPLAY directly throughout their code will make it easier to swap the code to different types of displays. 


51:40 @danh
   * Are we ready for 6.0.0 final? One new 6.0.0 issue re grayscale oled.
   * @jepler: https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/3649 weird esp32s2 crash I ran into, replicated by someone else
