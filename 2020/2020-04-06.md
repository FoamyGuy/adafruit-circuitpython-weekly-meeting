Overall: 5.1.0 stable released last week.  The RC had no major issues.  Let us know if you find any.  We are looking towards a new unstable release coming soon with lower power. In terms of the libraries, we are going through infrastructure issues and getting things up to standards.  These things are more housekeeping than they are code changes.  Melissa has been doing great stuff with blinka.  There’s a new guide on adding a new board.  We are making great progress on everything.

@KingerNorth (lurking)


35:22 @MakerMelissa
* Last Week
   * Went through all the boards on circuitpython.org and looked up their Add Dates and added those to all boards.
   * Added a sort by Date Added feature to circuitpython.org.
   * Added an RSS feed to circuitpython.org
   * Finished up some finishing touches to my Blinka guide and got that published.
   * Finished up the reskin to the Web Bluetooth dashboard and that is now live.

   * Add a section to Raspberry Pi guides about removing Kernel drivers for PiTFT
   * Figure out my next projects.


36:53 @Mr. Certainly (lurking)
* aside from working, I've just picked up a first-gen Surface Book. Been a mac user for ages, and I needed a bare-metal Windows machine for some accessories I want to use for streaming.


@sdw_nj (lurking)


37:17 @sommersoft
* Last Week:
   * Adabot:
      * Removed remaining code related to TravisCI for CircuitPython functions.
      * Changed the repository label validator to automatically add any of the missing standard labels ('bug', 'documentation', etc).
      * Fixed the CircuitPythonLibrarians permissions validator.
      * Started working on the "needs release" validator to exclude CI-related changes. Currently working by filtering out dotfiles (.github/, .pylintrc) only. Can extend beyond that.
   * RosiePi:
      * Getting closer to running tests again. The new architecture has test-trigger (via web server) and test-running (via queue scheduler) separated across user environments for security. This led to some silent-failures and lost tracebacks, which are hard to debug. Getting them now, so progress sped up over the weekend.
      * Started thinking about changing my hand-rolled test syntax to something utilizing `unittest` or `pytest`. Thanks Brian Okken/Test & Code podcast. :D
* This Week:
   * adabot: 
      * Finish up "needs release" changes
      * Work on a patch to add `black --check` to each library's Actions build.yml.
   * RosiePi: keep pushing through test-running failures, now that I'm catching most of the failures.
   * Work with Kattni increasing the knowledge of Adabot


40:24 @tannewt
* Released BLE MIDI library. Still need to bundle it.
* Spent time debugging it with JerryH. Worked ok after iPad forget. Will see if there is more work to make it reliable.
* @JohnPark’s project this week uses it so some time will be spent helping him.
* Helped @Hierophect with linking stuff.
* Circled back to lower_power again. Testing PulseIn across all platforms that have it. Fixed a couple reliability bugs on Friday and hope it’ll make everything else quicker.
* Hope to get through testing faster than last week and then switch to ESP32-S2. Need a break from a multi-port change.
* Limor has also tasked me with reverse engineering a USB protocol for a fever scanner that only has a proprietary Windows app. Looking forward to using ViewSB for it.
* Outside of CircuitPython:
   * Animal Crossing
   * Age of Empires 2
   * PCB layout and PSS-30 hacking
   * Runs!
   * Making pizza tonight.


43:46 @v923z
* Last week: found and fixed a couple of bugs in ulab, added a couple of new functions and features, updated documentation
* Coming week: no plans yet, as far as programming is concerned, otherwise, PCB design




44:36 @AndrewTribble (Lurking)
* This week:
   * Begin working on a neopixel based, CircuitPython run, system of RGB Hexagon lights as a bit of RGB Wall Art. Going to try to make a full hexagon be addressible as a single pixel within the Neopixel library by making a custom board using a WS2811 on a custom PCB to get some PCB experience as well.
* Outside of CircuitPython:
   * Been playing some GTA 5 LSPDFR+, a plugin that takes the core concept of GTA 5 and flips it on its head, so the player is playing as Law Enforcement and is responsible for writing tickets, making arrests, and overall crime prevention. 


@anecdata (lurking)


@anneb (lurking)


@cater (lurking)


45:33 @CGrover
* Wrapped up all the chronos projects after redoing the power wiring; just wasn’t happy with the bulky wires. Since all of the data and low-power wiring was wire-wrapped, only two solder joints and two splices were needed. Quick and easy and brought back memories of some large-scale wire-wrap projects from quite a few years ago.
* Added dew point and heat index helpers to the Cedargrove_Unit_Converters library. Working on wind chill and apparent temperature (AT) converters next. Looking forward to trying out the AT method when going for walks -- it’s an Australian approach for combining heat index and wind chill.
* Still have two lonely PCBs to assemble and test over the next week. Hope to get those done so that I can get back to designing more. Really want to try my hand at flex circuits.
* Outside activities: Working on another solo album, developing some cinematic themes that have been floating around in my head for a few years. Feeding/watching the birds in the backyard. Getting back into scratch cooking; success rate is better than 50%.


48:04 @charlesburnaford
* I haven’t been doing a whole lot but I’m still pecking away at getting a reliable keyboard interface in CircuitPython.  Trying to do an 88-key keyboard from a company called Syntaur and trying to discover a reliable way to wire it.  After-touch and velocity sensitivity are tricky.
* Outside of CIrcuitPython, playing around with a Grand Central and a remote camera at the gate for brother in law’s horse farm for safety reasons.


49:33 @danh
* Finishing up UF2 bootloader SAMD51 spurious writes fix. Had to fix a number of remaining minor issues. Getting a Linux crash (!) on `storage.erase_filesystem()`: need to check if this is related to the bootloader or is a coincidence. Will make a release very shortly.
* Fixed an issue with default args for `BLERadio.start_scan()`.
* Contributed to and reviewed SAMD51 support for Arduino library https://github.com/cmaglie/FlashStorage.
* This work, tasks include:
   * Finish bootloader.
   * Add bootloader download links to circuitpython.org for each board.
   * Continue working on Adafruit sensors services library and server program.

@geekguy (lurking)


56:55 @hierophect
* Last week
   * Added support for the F767 Nucleo board, and the F7 series generally
   * Added MPU (memory protection unit) and TCM (tightly coupled memory) support to the H7
   * Generally restructured how the STM32 port deals with linker files and startup to improve clarity and reduce waste
   * Dealt with a lot of hardfaults
   * Personal
      * Got myself a 3D printer, woo!
      * Practiced my first Screenless Sunday - it was really nice!
* This week
   * Work on module compatibility - making modules switch cleanly between the H7, F7 and F4. Mostly going to be a lot of reading and preprocessor stuff. 
   * Improve the documentation of the port, generally
   * Work on some of the global macro systems we use to reduce size
   * Do a lot of clean-up work for the PR so it’s ready to submit. 


@JacobT (lurking)


@jasonp (lurking)


1:00:42 @jepler
* Last week (& so far today):
   * Released 5.1.0, thanks to all who contributed
   * RGB matrix code “protomatter” working on samd and nrf
   * In play time, took my first steps in blinka and PureIO SPI, which @makermelissa is working on
* This week:
   * Reviewing @tannewt’s low power patches (looking forward to seeing this land)
   * Responding to protomatter review comments if more come in
   * Writing more code to use protomatter display.  Maybe some kind of stock ticker-style app, but it shows whimsical things and made up numbers?
* Continuing:
   * Walking outside is permitted here, so going on hour long walks daily.  Will wear a mask today.  Normalize mask wearing.
   * Cooking and baking


1:03:18 @jerryn
* Slowly migrating boards to 5.1.0 - no issues so far
* Next week -- no idea -- need to finish rfm9x PR
* Most of the time spent on a project or former day job.
   * Fun project -- getting cForth running on MicroSemi SmartFusion (cortex-m3)
      * Up and running -- trying to remember Forth!
      * The FPGA design engineer uses Forth to test/debug the interface operations.
* Saw some baby foxes today- very cute -- picture in #pet-photos


## 1:05:34 In The Weeds


1:06:04 @foamyguy Excellent guide for making user interfaces for PyPortal with displayio located here: https://learn.adafruit.com/making-a-pyportal-user-interface-displayio/the-full-code Guide makes use of the adt7410 temp sensor on the standard PyPortal but this causes it to crash on PyPortal Titano and Pynt which do not have the temp sensor. Proposal: small update to make the temp sensor usage optional with try/except so that the code will run on all versions of PyPortal devices. Possibly this one too: https://learn.adafruit.com/pyportal-mqtt-sensor-node-control-pad-home-assistant


1:12:20 @kattni - How do we want to handle libraries not intended for PyPI? Many have `setup.py.disabled` but it’s not consistent. Any objection to this as the standard?
* @sommersoft: just to note -
   * The Actions release.yml looks for `/setup.py`. If it’s not found, then associated PyPi actions are skipped.
   * Adabot on the other hand, flags the repo if it is missing `setup.py`. This makes it confusing as to which libraries actually should be on PyPi. Easily adjusted, but having this “what is the standard” answered will drive those adjustments.
* Also include reason in setup.py.disabled
* Include for Blinka req check


1:15:06 @kattni - Find out what the best way to get newsletter info from community members to Anne.
* Put in a PR to the newsletter repo
* Twitter - tag #circuitpython on a tweet
* Or email anneb@adafruit.com - include something about newsletter in subject


1:17:19 @hierophect - I had someone reach out to me about how we could facilitate casual circuitpython hanging out like the hardware meetup. Maybe @tannewt might have ideas based on the hardware meetup? 
* Bit of a work in progress with the hardware meetup, ended up being mostly news and discussion in a single channel
* The OSHA summit was a good example of splitting people into different discussion areas.
* Might want to facilitate organic groups by having people vote for the topics they’d like to chat about. 
* Start by checking out the hardware meetup.
