New design, updates, and more features on circuitpython.org
circuitpython.org has an updated look and more features as we kick off 2020. The site is even better at showing what’s possible with CircuitPython! The home page has descriptive text on why CircuitPython is easy to use, features, goals for the project, and more. Downloads features over 100 boards and now has a counter of how many boards that are supported. The same for Blinka, the boards and a counter, over 35+. Libraries, the CircuitPython library bundle contains all current libraries available for CircuitPython, over 200+. Handy links for how to contribute, the latest news (RSS feed too!), the awesome-circuitpython resource, the newsletter with all past ones we sent out, help, a link to our Discord server, and how to get started. Whew!

## 29:50 Status Updates


30:26 @tannewt
* Wrapping up iMX PR and Apple Media PR.
* Getting caught up on email and recentered. Was too heads down in iMX.
* Will do next Beta if Dan doesn’t want to.
* Need to document all Adafruit BLE APIs and UUIDs. Also create standard sensor services.
* BLE Midi and bug fixing after that.
* Going to lock down NeoPixel library for CircuitPython librarians from Write to Triage so that we have to be more deliberate with releases. Lots of people use it so we need to be very aware of when we do a release. Will it mess up Adabot? 
   * @sommersoft: Shouldn’t affect Adabot, unless the bundle gets locked down. Patching will likely suffer, but that’s low-interval at best.


34:52 @cater
* Added some fake buttons to PyGamer based on joystick
* Settable i2c addresses for charlcd, added that.
* Changed the example in display_button, the simpletest was complex, made a truly simple example using built in font etc.
* Involved with various pixelbuf stuff.


36:09 @CGrover (text only, occasional lurking)
* Last week:
   * Wrapped up the code review and started the Learning Guide for the Thermal Camera project. Hope to wrap it up in a couple of days. TFTs aren’t very photogenic video-wise.
   * Tested three Unit Conversion modules (time, temperature, electronics) with elements that support current Cedar Grove projects.
   * Purple PCBs gathering dust. They stopped staring at me and are whispering among themselves. I think they’re plotting an escape.
* Next week:
   * Complete the Thermal Camera Learning Guide.
   * Create a project plan to extend/expand the Unit Converter library and eventually make it available for public consumption.
   * Complete the code for the secret heirloom project. Looking through the antique stores for a suitable project enclosure. May have to warm up the woodshop instead.


@charlesburnaford (lurking)


37:02 @danh
* Finished BLE bonding. Core CircuitPython and BLE library PR’s are merged!
* Helped John Park with BLE HID example for new guide.
* Trying to wrap up 5.0.0.


38:00 @Dave Briccetti (away)
* Learning about Circuit Playground Bluefruit and planning to write some example code using the Python library, https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_CircuitPlayground.


38:21 @DavidGlaude (lurking / text only)
* Still, wondering what to say and show in 20 minutes in Fosdem’20 presentation. Maybe I should record myself for timing.
* Figuring that maybe I should do a GitHub with the demo code I could show: https://github.com/dglaude/Fosdem20CircuitPython (right now two PyPortal Cheerlight demo)


39:06 @DrewFustini
* Working on some PWM issues in Blinka, then found Blinka didn’t work with BBGreen, working on adding handling that into Platform Detect. Hopefully have PR soon.


@duewester (lurking)


39:43 @foamyguy 
* Last week:
   * Put the finishing touches on the Android Bluefruit Playground app
* Next Week:
   * Diving in to see where I can help with Issues and PRs 
   * Vetting a Proof of Concept for making similar “Playground” apps for CPX and possibly other devices.


@geekguy (lurking)


41:33 @hierophect
* Had to upgrade to a new PC and get everything installed and working, so not a super productive week.
* Solved the issue we were encountering with the UF2 bootloader, which had to do with the location of the vector table - it’s been solved, which will both enable the use of the Meowbit bootloader and enable UF2 on other boards in the future. 
* Generally got better at GDB
* Been working on a couple of DisplayIO bugs which should be resolved soon. 
* This coming week, Meowbit wrapup, and tackling my last 5.0 feature related to temperature. Have had interest in RotaryIO and PulseIO so hopefully getting to those soon. Still have a pile of boards that need implementing, too, and we need UF2 support. 


@jasonp (Lurking)


43:34 @jepler
* Last week:
   * Performance enhancements for AudioMixer PR’d, needs some rework
   * Investigating SD performance for MP3 playback & interaction of GC and SD reads (concrete result: bumped SD SPI rate in JEplayer)
   * Investigating “right channel only” MP3 & AudioMixer glitches on samd51.  Turns out right channel was delayed by 1 buffer in MP3.  However, “fixing” it made things worse, so haven’t PR’d yet and feel like there’s something I’m still missing.  
   * There’s also something weird with RawSample and AudioMixer and the right channel, but that sort of got lost in the shuffle of “I’m testing all sorts of different things”.
* This week:
   * JEplayer UI work is actually happening!  That’s top priority, but maybe I’ll get to some of the following too.
   * Investigating a different way of “coupling” left and right channels in samd audio_dma.c, potentially getting rid of the “single channel” flag in audio sample API (and fixing MP3 and AudioMixer right channel glitches?  maybe?)
   * Investigating how much of adafruit_sdcard would have to be C-coded to avoid GC pauses during read from SD in background tasks
   * Responding to review comments on AudioMixer performance PR
* Ongoing not so fun events:
   * Minor foot surgery this Friday, but expect to be back Monday.


47:14 @jerryn
* Still working on “reliable datagram” mode for the RFM9x/69
   * Finding some places to speed up timing
   * Struggling with timing on Raspberry Pi under Blinka
      * Raspberry Pi 4 is nice!!  Really want to target Pi Zero
* Did some testing of new Teensy 4.0 version
   * Ran into an issue reading libraries from flash -- looks like a workaround will be available soon.


51:14 @kattni
* Last week and Monday:
   * Fritzing objects
   * ItsyBitsy nRF52840 guide
   * Update Circuit Playground README
   * Add explanation of Circuit Playground library to Made Easy guide
   * Began PyCon 2020 planning discussion
* This week:
   * MLX90640 thermal camera product guide
      * Fritzing, PCBs to GitHub, etc.
   * Go through library PRs again
   * Finish explanation in Made Easy guide - need @DanH’s input
   * Update CP lib README to point at Made Easy guide
   * Update CP lib to have NotImplementedError
      * Increase stack size in CircuitPython for CPX
   * Continued PyCon planning which will be ever present for the next few months.


@KingerNorth (lurking)


@kjw (lurking)


54:52 @makermelissa
* Last Week:
   * Worked on HT16K33 LED Backpack Driver Updates and adding lots of new features and porting over features from the FeatherWing library
   * Worked on updating HT16K33 LED Backpack Guide pages
   * Worked on testing lots of Platform_Detect and Blinka Pull Requests
   * Tested an SSD1306 Pull Request to make sure existing displays still worked
   * Reviewed several CircuitPython.org Pull Requests
   * Spent the weekend setting up my windows computer to dual boot to Windows 10 and Windows 7 to be able to do more testing.
* This week:
   * Finish up HT16K33 Guide Updates
   * Focus more on getting Blinka running better and adding more boards
   * Start on Pine64 Blinka Guide


@Mr. Certainly (lurking)


@mscosti (text only/lurking)


56:13 @sommersoft (text only)
* Last Week:
   * RosiePi:
      * With the preliminary security design choices made, development needs to move to the Raspberry Pi environment. So, I worked on changes to the Ansible configuration for the new system, to understand/verify what approaches can be automated. New config is about 80% done, and is passing check runs.
      * Verified my assumptions on repository transfers and org accounts, created a new org, and transferred one repository to the new org account. I'd like to continue cleaning the others up (working trees, branches, etc) before transferring them. The new location for all of the repositories: https://github.com/physaCI
* This Week:
   * RosiePi/physaCI:
      * Continue repository transfers
      * Continue setting up the new environment on the RPi
   * Adabot:
      * Start working on the request to tweak the reports to show merged PR info.
   * Test @jepler's AudioMixer PR (Sorry I didn't get it over the past weekend! Ansible drug me into its vortex.)
