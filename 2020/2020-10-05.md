### A CircuitPython Programmable Watch
 CircuitPython Watch 

 CircuitPython Watch 

Twitter user TG-Techie is progressing with work on a watch running CircuitPython.
Choosing CircuitPython for the firmware was certainly the right choice, having a REPL makes testing on-board components easy as py.
In the latest updates, the new GUI framework is coming along - Twitter.

### 5:30 Join the Python Developers Survey 2020
Python Developers Survey 2020 

This year, the Python Software Foundation is conducting the fourth iteration of the official Python Developers Survey. The goal is to capture the current state of the language and the ecosystem around it. By comparing the results with last year’s, they can identify and share with everyone the hottest trends in the Python community and the key insights into it.
In 2019, more than 24,000 Python users from 150 countries participated and shared how they use the language.
Contribute to the community’s knowledge. The survey takes about 10 minutes to complete - Python Blog.


### 6:03 Unexpected Maker FeatherS2
 FeatherS2 

The FeatherS2 is a PRO ESP32-S2 based development board in a Feather format. This Feather has some nice extras: 16MB Flash, 8MB PSRAM, and a STEMMA QT/Qwiic connector. It comes flashed with CircuitPython 6.0 Beta 1 - Unexpected Maker.

* Other fun stuff: Repaint and add shelves to laundry room...


@microDev (lurking)


@Mr. Certainly [lurking]


@mytechnotalent - Kevin Thomas - [Lurking…]


28:04 @tannewt
* Released Beta 1! Will release Beta 2 in the next day or two to fix RGBMatrix.
* Fixed some digitalio issues on the ESP32S2. @ladyada found with the metro
* Working on iMX boot issues
* Likely onto fixing issues for the stable release


29:49 @makermelissa
* Last Week:
   * Wrote a spritesheet animation slideshow demo for John Park’s workshop
   * Did a Jetson Nano learn guide refresh including a new SPI page
   * Added a NeoPixel page using SPI to the guide
   * Figured out how to enable using more than 170 NeoPixels on the Jetson Nano by increasing SPI buffer size and added that info the the NeoPixel page
   * Updated AdafruitIO to allow increasing SPI buffer size with an environment variable.
   * Made some minor fixes to the PiTFT installer script
   * Wrote a Blinka Installer script for the Raspberry Pi that will perform a bunch of checks and update lots of things
   * Updated MatrixPortal library to work with both RGB Matrix FeatherWings
   * Fixed an issue with the Actions CI github repo that was causing any PRs that uses pre-commit hooks to fail
   * Worked on BrainCraft HAT guide which should be ready soon
   * Did an update of the boards on the circuitpython.org website
* This week:
   * Finish BrainCraft HAT guide
   * Update Machine Learning guide with BrainCraft HAT. I needed to finish the BrainCraft HAT guide first though.


31:34 @CGrover (text only)
* Finished the foundational Range_Slicer CircuitPython library and conducted some beta tests. Improved overall latency of the primary function from > 500us to ~340us -- and learned a lot about “real time” coding schemes in the process. Wrapping up the concept video this week.
* Two new projects for the Eurorack will commence next week: a CV X-Y ‘scope and precision VCO. Both will borrow heavily from the Range_Slicer library and hardware implementation.


@charlesburnaford (lurking)


@dave p (lurking)


32:16 @david.glaude (lurking)
* Heavy work on detecting COVID apps:
   * CLUE version based on work by @kjw: https://twitter.com/DavidGlaude/status/1311435336686473216?s=20
   * Simplified version for CPB: https://twitter.com/DavidGlaude/status/1311791062445371398?s=20
* First (since a long time) direct order from @adafruit (I hope not too bad surprise from custom and VAT): QT-Py, Matrix Portal, BrainCraft, ...


32:47 @deshipu
* Making lots of keyboards recently:
   * https://hackaday.io/project/174095-dorsch-40k-keyboard
   * https://hackaday.io/project/174917-dorsch-48k-keyboard

* Testing the code in an older PyGamer Thermal Camera guide and getting it updated for the latest PyBadger library.
* Testing to replicate an issue with Feather STM32F405 + Feather Crickit resulting in seemingly random “OSError: [Errno 5] Input/output error”. Are there any known issues with i2c / bus_device on STM32F405 that produce this error?
* Over the weekend I built the circuit and a 3D printed box for a BLE “Smart” USB Charger that shuts off when the phone indicates the battery is full.


35:17 @hierophect
* Last week:
   * Added AnalogIn to ESP32S2
   * Switched the ESP-IDF from a custom fork to the main master branch, which required some git shenanigans

* This week
   * Update the STM32F405 guide
   * Make sure ongoing PRs pass CI and can be accepted
   * Finish Analogout
   * Test CAN bus from Jeff
