### M60 Mechanical Keyboard 


Makerdiary has developed a mechanical keyboard using the nRF52840 microcontroller to provide connectivity through USB-C and BLE 5.0 Bluetooth. And the keyboard runs using CircuitPython so it's fully customizable (just drop a new file onto the flash drive the board presents) - Makerdiary and GitHub.

## 27:05 Status Updates


27:45 @jepler
* Last week: Background tasks & ticks
* This week: More of the same -- hopefully in the home stretch
* Running this meeting :)


28:35 @jerryn
* What happened to that week!  -- nothing notable to report.
* Next week -- I have no idea...


28:13 @kattni
* Last week:
   * Updated board files on GitHub for the TXB0104
   * Created PCF8591 Fritzing
   * Updated BH1750 fritzing with product copy
   * Mostly finished up the guide to running the CircuitPython Weekly meeting
   * Started the guide for the PMSA300I, fritzing created, PCB files uploaded.
   * Ordered PMSA300I
   * Got @fede2 started with translating the Circuit Playground Express guide - this one is huge and includes mirrored pages from other guides, so he’ll begin by translating the MakeCode for CPX guide first, then move on to beginning the CPX Guide proper.
   * Removed the PyPortal library from PyPI - I had done most of the work already, but had neglected to delete the project from PyPI. Resolved.
   * Verified I have the PM2.5 Air Quality sensor 
   * Updated the BMP280 guide with the STEMMA QT version
   * Wrote up the Welcome blurb for the Adafruit Discord server, got it proofed by the team, it’s basically ready to go.
* This week:
   * Create @imitationkattni Discord account and join the Adafruit server to verify what that experience looks like so we can deploy the Welcome channel appropriately, and verify our upcoming Welcome screen.
   * Setup Welcome screen on Adafruit Discord server to point people to a few key channels with a little more detail as to what we’re about.
   * Update CircuitPython on Linux and Raspberry Pi guide with PWMOut now supported by Blinka, to pulse an LED and control a servo.
   * Update the CircuitPython Servo guide to mention Raspberry Pi as it is now supported.
   * Once I receive the PSMA300I, finish guide.
   * Update PM2.5 guide to use fancy new library - potentially reusing content from PMSA300I (same code).
   * Figure out how to update the Contributing to Git and GitHub guide to have references to `main` default branch, while still including `master` until we have moved the entire project over - this will take some consideration.
   * Once Git/Hub guide is updated, move a few highly trafficked CircuitPython libraries from `master` to `main` default branch.
   * Create accounts needed to start getting PyPI download stats again.
   * Help a community member with submitting a library to the community bundle.


34:27 @kmatch98 text only
Last week
* Bug fixes and updates to adafruit_display_text (label.py) to eliminate zero-sized tileGrids and provide memory-reduced option when background color is absent.
This week
* Need to update Sparkline library per foamyguy recommendations
Other projects
* Demo rev1 mechanical seven segment numerical display. 


34:58 @MakerMelissa
* Last Week:
   * Finished writing Blinka Displayio/PyPortal library guide
   * Built the Election Calendar project on Raspberry Pi and wrote up a blog post
   * Fixed bug in Blinka related to PWM and Duty Cycle that Kattni found
   * Fixed Arduino ImageReader eInk 1-bit per pixel Bitmap displaying
   * Started working on a couple of eInk Bonnet guides
   * Fixed a header name issue with the Learn Guide Repo
* This week
   * Finish up writing EInk Bonnet guides


@Mr. Certainly [lurking]


35:51 @stargirl (offline)
* Wrote a blog post about how to set up the ADC on the SAMD21 from scratch.


36:01 @tannewt
* Added json.load support for any object with readinto.
* Made good progress on ESP32SPI re-organization. Need to debug why it’s not working to load a webpage.
* Will disable existing native networking APIs
* May start native Wifi and socketpool APIs if re-org is tiresome.


@anecdata (lurking)


@anneb (lurking)


38:27 @brentru
* LW: 
   * Updated MiniMQTT for compatibility with CPython sockets
      * Might still have some things to implement which reduce amount of buffers we create in the library
   * Slowly working thru a bug in minimqtt which doesn't allow you to send large files like images, not sure what the problem is.
* TW:
   * Spending today looking at Jinja templating to generate code.py files 
      * Starting with blink.py to get the hang of jinja and flask
   * Hopefully will have something interesting/working by wednesday’s S&T


39:43 @CGrover (text only)
* Had a breakthrough with the automated Eurorack module cable detection scheme. The stable prototype is on the bench and working! It can detect up to eight attached TS input cables (with or without a signal) in less than 1ms. Converting the code to a library to make it easier to use. A new RangeSlicer PCB design for the module is in the works as a result. 
* Trying to digest more of ulab’s capabilities. Have a couple of EuroClue ideas that will depend on me getting over a hurdle or two, particularly involving FFT functions. May need a brain transplant.


@charlesburnaford (lurking)


40:33 @danh
* Continuing work on HCI version of _bleio. Just started testing advertising.
* Looked into various bootloader trouble reports.


@davep  (lurking)


41:50 @DavidGlaude
Last week:
* Testing PMS5003 comparing behaviour with the learn guide code, with the Adafruit_CircuitPython_PM25 and with Pimoroni library. Raising issues, suggesting change, … contacting Limor and Phil (Gadgetoid).
* Recovered my Mini PiTFT 240x240 and started trying to run Gizmo or CLUE exemple code on it. Those have in common the same 240x240, 2 buttons and BLE… so the more or less the same code could run on those three.


@deshipu (lurking)


43:50 @fede2 (lurking)
         Last week: es translation at 100%
            This week: Testing new json lib from @tannewt.
                              Slowly learning, hoping to review one day


44:11 @foamyguy
        Last week
* Testing a few display_text PRs
* Gorillas game is now playable for 2 players on 1 device. Started on RF version.
* Add Pybadger library support for CPB + Gizmo
* First time setting up MySQL. Done to test an example that shows how to use Blinka to pull data from sensor and store in DB
* Help find and fix invalid discord links in readme files
        This week
* Work on 2 player wireless functionality for Gorillas game
* Work on PyBadger support for Hallowing M4
* Solder and learn to use RTC Breakout
* Play with ESP32-S2!


 46:21 @hierophect
* Last week:
   * Kind of a slow week because of moving stuff.
   * Worked on my timer allocator
   * Rewrote some RGBMatrix code to fit timer allocator
   * Identified a regression in the main branch for PulseIO that may have been caused by the low power feature
* Next week
   * Hopefully wrap up all this timer nonsense with finished PRs to both RGBMatrix and Circuitpython
   * Add timer support to the H7 and F7
   * Add RotaryIO, which should be fairly trivial with the new timer system
   * Evaluate priorities after that - probably a mix of bugfixes and ESP32-S2


## 48:40 In The Weeds
@David.Glaude (present but mic not checked… can be done without me or next week if it fail):
* Suggestion to do something similar to https://pinout.xyz/ (for Raspberry Pi) but for FeatherWing. Trying to centralise pin usage and possible compatibility issues between various FeatherWing and Feather. @Gadgetoid is one of the actors behind pinout.xyz and this work is independent from Pimoroni he works for. I believe the site is mostly static to reduce hosting cost and is open source (except the some graphic) where board makers can contribute via GitHub. Compatibility check: https://pinout.xyz/phatstack 
* 56:06 Discuss partially supported board on CircuitPython.org (part of issue https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython-org/issues/501)
## 1:00:06 Wrap-Up
