## 5:28 Community News
If any of you are looking for a mini-tutorial on getting started with Adafruit streaming data check out this tutorial that @foamyguy @anecdata and I put together here. https://github.com/mytechnotalent/CircuitPython_IoT_Streaming_Data


5:56 micro:bit version 2
The Micro:bit Educational Foundation [announced](https://twitter.com/microbit_edu/status/1315887490180448257) the [new micro:bit](https://microbit.org/new-microbit/) - available in November at the same price point as the original.
The latest micro:bit will fit right in to your existing lessons and materials; MakeCode and MicroPython code will work in the same way as they do on the original micro:bit. More features, including easy ways to take AI and ML into the classroom, will be released throughout 2021.
Some new features of the board:
* A more powerful Nordic nRF52833 processor
* A MEMS microphone and speaker
* Capacitive touch sensor pad
* Power saving mode

More details: [Video – Meet the latest micro:bit](https://youtu.be/pIUJ4kvJ_QU), [announcement page](https://microbit.org/new-microbit/), [tech specs](https://tech.microbit.org/latest-revision/), and [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2020/10/13/the-new-bbc-microbit-v2-announced-microbit-microbit_edu/).

6:49 Raspberry Pi 4 Compute Module
The Raspberry Pi 4 Compute Module was announced Monday. Containing the same processor as the Raspberry Pi 4, it has various RAM and Flash options at purchase (but no on-board expandability). The board breaks from previous modules, coming in a new form factor. I/O signals are brought out to two high-density perpendicular connectors (one for power and low-speed interfaces, and one for high-speed interfaces).


There is also an IO carrier board available which breaks out all the interfaces available including a PCI-E x1 slot. CAD for the IO board is available in KiCad format.

9:11 Why Learning Python is Perfect for Beginners, Career-Changers, and Anyone Else

Maybe you’re looking for a language that’s useful and powerful, but still accessible to new coders. Maybe you’ve already started coding and you’re considering Python, but not sure if it’s the right language for you. Whatever your situation or current level of coding knowledge, this post will help you decide if you should learn Python or not - [Learn to Code with Me](https://learntocodewith.me/resources/why-learn-python/).

Overall (blinka): Right now blinka is excited to add support for the pi 4 compute module when it comes out, and trying to add all kinds of boards as they come in.  Over the last weeks we’ve been doing fixes such as the Adafruit PureIO module now supporting Python 3.9 and the requirements.txt has been updated accordingly.

* Working on internal ESP-S2/FPGA SPI Bus (see InTheWeeds notes later)


@hobowan (lurking)


@Jayguitar (lurking)


41:58 @jepler
* Last week: 
   * Mostly worked on CAN implementation for Arduino on SAM E51
   * Finishing up an RPN calculator guide, which was delayed from this summer
* This week:
   * Monthly check of guide feedback
   * Hopefully starting on CAN support for the ESP32S2
   * Up next is more ESP32S2 stuff, possibly AudioOut


43:15 @jerryn
* Updating several boards to 6.0.0-rc0 -- no issues so far.
* Received an unexpectedMaker feathers2 board - checking it out. 
* Ran into some issues testing bno08x breakout.
   * Works normally on grandcentral m4.
   * Crashes on esp32s2 (both saola_wrover and umfeathers2)
      * Filed issue against CP -- not sure if it is library or CP.
   * Also found some issues when using bno08x on RPi.
        
46:50 @jmarcelino
* Initial port of CircuitPython to the nRF52840 based RAK4631, part of RAK’s Wisblock LoRa enabled modular IoT board - https://wisblock.io
* Started work on porting TinyLora to newest SX1262 chip

47:48 @kattni
   * Last week:
   * Published a QT Py and LEDs guide for QT Py and QT Py Haxpress
   * Added FAQ to LED Animation guide with two questions regarding using SAMD21 M0 non-Express, and SAMD21 M0 Express boards with the library. (Spoiler: There’s limitations.)
   * Included an example to reset the board if time.monotonic() exceeds 3600 (1 hour) to avoid loss of precision timing for animations - only needed on M0 boards. Keeps the animations from slowing down. There’s a very simple explanation of what happens in this FAQ. Check the CircuitPython issues list for a very complicated (and thorough) explanation of what’s happening.
   * Created two fritzing objects
   * Brainstormed QT Py project ideas
   * This week:
   * Bring QT Py project idea one to life: Sequential activity timer / hydration reminder. Think of it as an alternative to the pomodoro timer technique which doesn’t work for everyone.
   * Start guide for timer project.
   * 4 more fritzing objects
   * Update a couple of guides with new product revision info by end of week


@kthomas - Kevin Thomas - [Lurking…] Read-Only


52:06 @kmatch98
   * No electronics progress to report
   * This week: get Circuitpython running on recently received Saola ESP32-S2
   * Last 2 weeks - finished refurbish of our washroom, added storage


@makahernandez (lurking)


52:52 @MakerMelissa
   * Last Week:
   * Finished writing BrainCraft Google Assistant guide
   * Fixed an issue with the SSD1351 on the ESP32 in Arduino
   * Updated some new boards on CircuitPython.org that were added with the latest release
   * Fixed a wiring diagram for the SSD1331 in a guide
   * Updated Adafruit PureIO library to work with Python 3.9
   * This Week:
   * Write a guide on creating projects using the MatrixPortal library
   * Go through any guide comments and make necessary changes
   * Update remaining PiTFT guides with latest instructions
   * Likely write a product guide later in the week
   * Other Stuff:
   * Worked more on my keyboard and decided to use Logic Level shifters so I can use more boards, though the ones I used had a propagation delay issue. It’s likely I will move to CircuitPython for running the keyboard MIDI.
   * Planning on traveling back home this coming weekend.


54:40 @microDev (text only/not present)
   * Last week I implemented a method to set custom hostname of wifi interface.
   * This week I plan to collaborate with @tannewt on deep sleep API.


@Mr. Certainly [lurking]


@mytechnotalent - Kevin Thomas - [Lurking…]


31:12 @tannewt
   * Last week I fixed 6.0.0 issues and did the rc.0 release.
   * This week I’m continuing my deep sleep API work.
   * If issues come up with RC0, will take a look and figure out whether they’re blocking or not.  If we find issues that make it unstable we’ll do a RC1
   * Will branch 6.0 from RC0 when we create an RC1 (or general release)
   * I voted this weekend and need to drop off my ballot today!

@Warriorofwire (lurking)
## 55:06 In The Weeds
55:40 @dh-metre
   * 58:16 How to best implement ble device management.  
   * Use cases connect with remote app, file upload, async with device function and HID on device.
   * 1:06:18 How to implement a high priority synchronous i2c time series data capture (~1ms) to disk…
   * Currently other background (not entirely characterized) interrupts interfere but ideally there would be to do this sampling and recording in the background
   * Use cases:
   * Time series capture with all python pipelines from device, to phone app, to cloud to Jupyter notebook / cloud function pipeline.
   * Remote device debug/ file management / housekeeping during development
1:19:57USB reloads
1:21:05 @foamyguy
   * Is there any interest in including a Monster M4sk library in the main bundle? Or is community bundle more appropriate? https://github.com/FoamyGuy/Adafruit_CircuitPython_MonsterM4sk
   * @kattni - main bundle


1:27:22 @folknology
   * Is it possible for CP top support SPI CS in hardware to avoid the large bitbang overhead of CS when issuing many small (single register write/read) transactions?
   * 1:32:19 Is there a CP library/tool that provides CPU usage stats/data BTW?


1:24:04 @David.Glaude [if not too late] (maybe no microphone, but fire your idea)
   * How would you abstract NeoPixel vs DotStar vs NeoTrellis vs “alternative ordered set of color” to use the same code on various hardware? My CoronaApp detector display information with “pixel of color”, and I would like to simplify my code to be independent of the way to display.
