Overall: That was an awesome week first and foremost.  We are continuing to add libraries as adafruit adds products.  We’re seeing activity from other companies like pimoroni too.  On the core side we need to get 6.0 out the door.  We’ve been behind on getting releases out, but now that Dan is through with BLE HCI we’ll get past that and squash lots of bugs this fall.

32:18 @tannewt
* Error handling and debugging for wifi stuff last week.
* Sent out PR for PSRAM support on esp32s2
* Also have pending PR to create pwmio and move PWMOut to it.
* Once pwmio is in, will do another (long overdue) release
* Reviewing Dan’s work
* Getting native wifi stuff out for review

@v923z (lurking)

@anne b (lurking)

@cater (lurking)


33:52 @CGrover (text only)
* Wrapping up the final two feature requirements for the Range_Slicer Euro module (with the aforementioned roadblock). Abandoned the old prototype and created a new, smaller module.
* Boards, boards, boards. A new shipment from OSH Park. You know what that means.
* The transformation of the recording studio is nearly complete. The final step is to purge the old recordings and console settings from the Windows-based workstation and fully embrace the iMac implementation. Found a hoarder’s treasure of special settings and side-chain configurations that I used over the years. Most are simply historical and won’t make it to the new workstation.


@Charlesburnaford (lurking)


34:38 @danh
* _bleio HCI testing before submitting a PR. After disabling debugging logging, some things stopped working. Since I could not use print statements for debugging, I connected a Saleae to an ESP32 breakout to monitor the UART traffic. I found and fixed several bugs, and created PR’s for circuitpython and the BLE library late last week.
* Fixed a regression in the BLE library.
* Did a lot of clicking to approve automated library PR’s.


@Dave P (lurking)


36:14 @David.Glaude
* CircuitPython:
   * Further work on PM25 and IS31FL3731 (and made git rebase for that one)
   * Adapted my RGB Matrix Featherwing (for M4) to support 64x64 matrix with just one more wire: https://twitter.com/DavidGlaude/status/1296249019107348485
   * Working on the consequence of the release of the lsm6ds library on CLUE and PyBadge library together with some learn guide.
* Colour Maximite2:
   * Controlling the 64 Neopixel from Unicorn HAT
   * HDMI encoding to be able to stream/record the output

@deshipu (lurking)


37:31 @foamyguy
* Last week:
   * Testing PN532 PR to allow trigger pin usage
   * Testing out several PRs related to new LSM6DS library
   * Soldered 7x15 Charlie Wing and played around with it
   * Played with Bitmap.blit() some and created a few scripts test out the speed increase
   * Small change to ProgressBar width and height to make them public
   * Ran into an issue with SDCard and OnDiskBitmap causing PyPortal to get stuck

43:41 @jepler
* Last week:
   * Started canbus work in earnest
   * A bunch of library pylint PRs over the weekend, most merged
* This week:
   * Continuing canbus work -- hope to send a packet from samd51 soon
* Fun stuff:
   * Will be turning my ongoing RPN calculator project into a guide after canbus


45:19 @jerryn
* Thought I had a quick update to RFM69 library to reduce code size and freeze into CP.
   * Spent a lot of time dealing with an very obscure issue with RFM69 on SAMD21 boards
      * After a lot of confusion it appears to be an issue with the SPI baudrate
      * Will discuss “in the weeds”
* Hope to be able to move on….


46:20 @kattni
* Last week:
   * Finished the lib PR sweep
   * Merged, commented, closed, etc many PRs.
   * Did the weekly CircuitPython lib release sweep.
   * Tested a PR from Carter adding digitalio to Adafruit_CircuitPython_Motor
   * Got through my assigned GitHub issues.
   * Updated the MotorKit guide and code to include using multiple I2C devices.
   * Updated the RGB Matrix FeatherWing guide to include nRF52840 wing
   * Blogged updated Matrix FW guide.
   * Added Feather M0 default files to default files repo.
* This week:
   * Review another set of PRs
   * Update the LIS3DH guide to feature the newly released STEMMA QT version
   * Review RGB Matrix CircuitPython guide to verify nRF inclusion
   * Stepper motor guide updates and additions
      * Updating the DRV8833 guide to include CircuitPython
      * Test on Raspberry Pi to include in guide.
      * Then add CP to TB6612, possibly same page, TBD.
   * Continue follow up on responses etc to PR sweep.


49:32 @kmatch98 (lurking)
* Bug fixes in display_text for placement and background box sizing, especially affecting script fonts
* Passed the PR checks for bitmap.blit
* This week: make bitmap_label to be mutable (to fully match label); learn how to avoid memory leaks

## 50:07 In The Weeds


50:44 @jerryn  (looks long but should not be)
* 50:55 SPI baudrate issue on SAMD21 boards. 
   * For RFM69 the default SPI baudrate is 5MHz
      * Long ago had issues at 10MHz so lowered it to 5MHz
   * Now finding it is unreliable on SAMD21  -- OK on SAMD51 - slowing to 1MHz works better
      * Data was getting received OK -- would not be passed to MCU if incorrect., but when read via SPI, the contents are wrong. No errors reported by SPI.
   * Any obvious reason for change?
   * Should it be set to 1MHz for all or add a note to the docstring and guide?
* 1:00:30 Question about migration to GCC 10
   * Do we want to move to GCC10 -Preview or wait for stable release
      * Has anyone built and loaded a SAMD51 board with GCC10?


1:03:28 @jepler
* Move meeting to September 9 (Wednesday) instead of September 8 (Tuesday) -- already displaced due to the US holiday of Labor Day (@anne B says yes)
* General agreement
* Look into streaming it live


1:05:21 @David.Glaude
* Make a checklist for spliting a library into a package => Release management for the libraries => Do we have a library dependency tree?
* How to deal with pylint annoyance when there is a version change / new rules.


1:23:41 @jepler (can skip this if everyone is getting fatigued)
* Pylint wants `raise … from`.  In CP it increases .mpy size a bit but doesn’t improve traceback quality.  On blinka it increases traceback quality.  I prepared an adabot patch to disable `raise … from` diagnostic altogether, but @danh seems to favor addressing them.  Anybody else with opinions?
try: 
…
except Exception as e:
raise OtherException() from e


Resolution: fix most of them; in special cases, do per-library, inline disables
