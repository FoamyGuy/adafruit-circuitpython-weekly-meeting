## 47:31 In The Weeds


@foamyguy - Unique devices identifiers in boot_out.txt. 


(scheduling conflict came up. May not be around for this section. We can skip it until next week if so)


This device seems to have two variants that would both have the same contents in their boot_out.txt file:


SparkFun Qwiic Micro with samd21e18


https://circuitpython.org/board/sparkfun_qwiic_micro_with_flash/
https://circuitpython.org/board/sparkfun_qwiic_micro_no_flash/


Each variant has it’s own folder in the ports folder so there are two different system image files, one for each variant.


I am interested in adding something to one or the other (or both) in the text that shows up in their boot_out file so that automated tools could theoretically tell them apart. Am interested to see if anyone has thoughts about or any opposition to this?


48:30 @jepler - holiday meeting calendar - I’ll PR the results into the meetings repo so the online calendar is up to date.  One possibility: Normal meetings December 7, 14, 21.  No meeting week of December 28.  Back to normal Monday January 4.


49:30 @brentru - wifi example naming


We have a large amount of network interfaces now (CPython, ESP32S2, Ethernet, Cellular, ESP32SPI)


Examples: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_AdafruitIO/tree/master/examples/adafruit_io_http and https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Requests/tree/master/examples


Which should we use for the simpletest? Native sockets + WiFi? Should libraries with lots of examples have folders for each interface: `examples/esp32spi, examples/ethernet`


Potential Solution: Folders, prepend the library name to the folder name. Keep the same _esp32spi.py at the end of examples


@tannewt - Start thinking about what you want to see out of CircuitPython in 2021.
##  54:21 Wrap-Up
