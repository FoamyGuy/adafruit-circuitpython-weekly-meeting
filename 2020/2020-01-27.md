## 29:25 Status Updates
30:44 @kattni
* Last week:
   * Added a NotImplementedError to Express module in Circuit Playground library to cover potentially importing features not available for CPX. Written to be expandable so it will be easy to add to it as we add more features to the other Circuit Playground modules.
   * Added page to Made Easy guide - The Technical Side - that goes into a technical explanation of how the Circuit Playground library works under the hood, and why it’s special on CPX. 
   * Linked to The Technical Side page in the Circuit Playground library README
   * Fixed image links in README
   * Worked on and finished up the guide for the MLX90640 Thermal Camera, put in moderation
   * Spun up @foamyguy to get him going on reviewing PRs, testing, making changes to open PRs to fix linting and change requests, and finally added to CircuitPythonLibrarians to give him edit/merge access.
* This week:
   * Test code one more time, then put in PR for update to Circuit Playground Sound Meter code to work on both Express and Bluefruit
   * Guide for DPS310
   * Go through lib PRs again
   * Go through guide feedbacks in Learn system
   * Remake a reference image currently being used in all guides with Metro-style boards of the ICSP header to make it easier to understand
   * Begin documenting running the CircuitPython Weekly meeting to facilitate others being able to run it


@KingerNorth (lurking)


36:16 @MakerMelissa
* Last Week:
   * Tested and Merged Blinka-related PRs
   * Worked with @JohnPark on a Now Playing Gizmo demo
   * Made a bunch of progress on LED Backpack Guide
* This Week:
   * Finish up LED Backpack Guide
   * Test 240x240 PiTFT on Raspberry Pi Examples
   * Create Arduino E-Paper FeatherWing Example
   * Update Arduino TFTLCD to GFX
   * Start on Adding Board to Blinka Guides


@Mr. Certainly (lurking)


@mscosti (lurking)


37:41  @ntoll (async):
* New (bugfix) release of Mu yesterday. Big change is the fix for Catalina users. Details here: https://madewith.mu/mu/releases/2020/01/26/mu-1-0-3.html


@sdw_nj (lurking)


37:59 @siddacious - Unavailable, please read
* Previously: Lots of driver work: refactoring and cleaning up code
* A few guides:  LIS3MDL and LSM6DS33
* Helping Dylan as needed with finishing up the actions migration
* Next: More guide work and driver refactoring


38:23 @sommersoft (text only)
* Last Week:
   * Core:
      * Tested & merged @jepler's AudioMixer performance improvements PR.
   * RosiePi:
      * Got the configuration scripts finished and installing without failure.
      * Started verifying services/etc are working properly. However, after getting Redis to work properly, it seems there is some dark magic to getting the systemd Redis service to actually stop. It is locking up shutdown/reboot, which is fun.
   * Adabot:
      * Investigated an error that the daily library report is having. Evidence points to an issue on GitHub's end. The API releases endpoint for the core repo seems to be having issues. (Did a setting/perm get changed, perhaps?)
* This Week:
   * Adabot:
      * Work on the report changes to list merged vs open PRs
      * Add some better handling of the aforementioned GitHub release endpoint error. It should fail gracefully…
   * RosiePi configuration...


39:25 @tannewt
* Short week last week. Primarily worked on PixelBuf.
* Reverted NeoPixel changes until good _pixelbuf is out in the stable release.
* Polishing up _pixelbuf changes this week.
* Committing Teensy 4.0 support this week although it isn’t perfect.
* Circling back to Bluetooth to prepare for 5.0.0!


@AnneB (lurking)


@arturo182 (lurking)


41:28 @ATMakers (I’m back)
* Loved judging the Hackaday Contest looking forward to the Gesture Sensors 
* XBox Adaptive Controller version of CP automated builds available here: https://github.com/ATMakersBill/cp4xac
* Guide 90% ready on the first CP XAC controller (PyRuler) - might not get done this week
* If you’re in Florida next weekend…. ATIA Maker Day is where you should be - just for the Accessible Gaming Lounge where you can see dozens of CP-driven controllers https://www.atia.org/atia-maker-day-3-0/


@Cater (lurking)


42:56 @CGrover (text only)
* Wrapped up two sound studio projects this week. Working on a third.
* The Thermal Camera Project learning guide is almost complete, seemingly at the project manager’s nightmare zone of 90% project completion. Developing the guide reminded me of the many new CircuitPython coding techniques and features learned during this project -- and that I have yet to learn. Each step forward is simultaneously satisfying and humbling.
* Started working through the Purple PCB backlog yesterday. This week will focus on completing and testing at least two boards.


43:37 @charlesburnaford:
* Working on a keyboard from old DX7. Hoping to interface it with Teensy 4.0 to use USB stuff to talk with synthesizer.


44:25 @codeNsolder
* Last week:
   * Worked on a demo for local Processing Day meetup using PyBadge, ESP32 airlift featherwing, neopixels and mini mqtt controlling badge over Internet(AdafruitIO)
   * Helped few folks from local community in getting started contributing to CP, helped them create a issues
* Next week:
   * Making a hardware to control adobe lightroom functions
   * Will be mentoring community folks with the created issues 


46:05 @danh
* Released CircuitPython 5.0.0-beta.4 last Tuesday evening.
* Fixed: Turn off on-board user neopixels on CPB, PyPortal, and PyGamer on soft-reload.
* Developed initial BLE Heart Rate Service and example code. Currently debugging some BLE-related hangs on reconnection.
* Will continue to fix 5.0.0 bugs for upcoming release.


@DaveP (lurking)


47:37 @dglaude
* Last week:
   * Tested BLE UID demo (without a rotary encoder… because I don’t have any).
   * Tested Blinka on my Ubuntu Thinkpad with FT232H (but should find an LED+resistor for real blink)
   * I guess reading doc and guide, and thinking about Fosdem’20.
* Next week:
   * Fosdem'20 : preparing slides, writing demo code, asking tricky questions to make sure what I say is accurate.


49:45 @drewfustini
* Added support for BBG to Platformdetect
* Added that into Blinka as well


@Duewester (lurking)






50:15 @foamyguy
* Last week:
   * Starting to get my feet wet with reviewing PRs
   * Learning about and playing with all things audio and circuitpython on the NeoTrellis m4
* Next week:
   * Keep going with reviews, and start looking for issues that I can help with
   * Playing with audio more. Perhaps building some interaction between the NeoTrellis and Android. 


@geekguy (Text Only)


51:10 @hierophect
* Last week:
   * Fixed an involved PWMOut error that was affecting displayIO.
   * Worked on wrapping up the final Meowbit bug, which was a displayIO flash/display conflict issue. It’s out as a PR and has passed initial testing from ladyada.
   * Laid out the pinmaps for the Espruino boards
* This week
   * Do any style or content changes required for the Meowbit PR
   * Set up controls for the Espruinos, wrap up pinmaps. 
   * UF2 bootloader support across STM32
   * Work on my Zephyr guide


@JacobT lurking


@jasonp (lurking)


52:38 @jepler
* Last week:
   * UI work on JEplayer
   * Started drafting a future Learn guide showing the software
   * Worked on providing ready to run mpy-cross binaries
   * Fuzz-tested mpy-cross and didn’t find any interesting crashes
   * Set up an AWS Lambda that can be called to mpy-compile a source file
* This week:
   * Continuing on the Learn guide—This, and any JEplayer improvements that are requested, is my highest priority.
   * Maybe getting back to low level audio stuff—testing whether both DACs can be written by one DMA, otherwise continuing with the existing draft PR to simplify SAMD stereo AudioOut
* Ongoing fun and not fun projects:
   * My custom keyboard is all wired and running KMK, a keyboard firmware written in CircuitPython.
   * Helped a friend set up a pipe temperature monitoring project with adafruit IO & IFTTT
   * Recovery from my foot surgery is going well, thanks to those who asked


54:30 @jerryn
* Frustrating week with regards to my rfm9x/69 updates.
   * Ran into significant issues with response time with CircuitPython when trying to communicate with Arduino/RadioHead 
   * I had forgotten how fast C code can run with Arduino….
   * Also ran into even worse problems with timing on the Raspberry Pi under Blinka -- There are significant delays between SPI transactions. This makes the above problems even worse.
   * Need to reconsider the whole approach...not a bad thing, but time consuming.
* Did a bit of testing of Teensy4.0
   * Accessed an I2C device
   * REPL not happy with cut/paste of more than a few lines - enters bootloader...
* Next few weeks -- life happening :-) will likely miss a few meetings due to conflicts and some travel
   * Will continue to work on rfm9x/69 as well as a whole bunch of other projects.


## 59:24 In the Weeds
59:50 @tannewt - thoughts on depth of CircuitPython 2020 wrap up? Last year’s is here: https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/01/28/circuitpython-in-2019/ Do we want more than a thank you,  some quick stats and links out to all of the posts?


1:01:08 @jepler - anybody interested in moving forward with the mpy-compile web interface / API?  I don’t want to be responsible for it.@g


1:04:11 @dglaude (1) => maybe to @tannewt - Is there a list of board that are supported both by CircuitPython and MicroPython (ESP excluded). This has been answered on discord.


1:05:27 @dglaude (2) => Phil(?) - Is it safe to say that all CircuitPython board from Adafruit are Open Hardware (with the PCB drawing on GitHub)? Any exceptions (Teensy is not from Adafruit)?


1:06:42 @dglaude (3) => maybe to @danh - Is it safe to say that CP 5.0 support the four BLE role: Central and Peripheral, Server and Client? I think the Heart Beat answer the question.


1:07:49 @dglaude (4) => Phil(?) - Why is the feedback form from learn.adafruit.com anonymous? How to get feedback on remarks? How to exchange with the guide writer?


1:09:52 @MakerMelissa:
* Idea for CircuitPython:
   * Compiled C modules that work with a common API so they aren’t processor specific
      * @hierophect I think micropython recently did something like this? (mentioned in my/deshipu’s CPy 2020s)
         * @Makermelissa: No idea. 
         * Micropython https://github.com/micropython/micropython/commit/aad79adab7285cbe1c1b975fcd490542fd3ab85c






1:15:50 @sommersoft (low-priority; can be deferred to a later date or as a GitHub issue) [text-only]
* Actions Triage (on the core):
   * I've been thinking about this for a while, but it popped back into my mind last week. What are the thoughts on writing up a bit of triage routine on the PR Actions workflow. Such that only the "necessary" builds are triggered based on a PR's changes.
   * Example: if a `git diff` reveals that a PR's changes only apply to the `docs/` folder, we skip building all 100+ boards for the PR. A recent scenario was @deshipu's PR to `docs/shared_bindings_matrix.py`; no firmware changes, but the CI build took 53 minutes…
   * You could conceivably extend this to scenarios like if a PR only contains changes to `ports/atmel-samd`, that non-SAMD builds are skipped.
   * This may drive some workflow structural changes; not sure if they would make things more obfuscated. Especially when it comes to adding new boards, and debugging workflow issues.
## 1:17:20 Wrap-up
